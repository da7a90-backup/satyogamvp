1	1	0	A Treasure Map	\N	To help the seeker of Truth fully understand what that means, Sat Yoga has elaborated a user-friendly map of the hidden treasures of reality, encompassing the entire spectrum of consciousness. We have also developed empowering operations for taking command of the mind. We offer these online and at our ashram, a self-sustaining spiritual community in the rural mountains of southern Costa Rica, where those seeking a shorter or longer retreat (or a permanent refuge) from this dying world can awaken latent powers and live joyously in Total Presence.	\N	0	2025-11-03 13:18:07.019642
2	1	1	An Agency for Intelligence Amplification	\N	The original Sat Yoga was already functioning as a means of increasing intelligence at the beginning of recorded history. It was deployed not only for wisdom but also for developing paranormal powers (siddhis). Yoga has served as the basis and engine of all religions, as well as the mystical, magical, and shamanic orders. In recent times, however, the term Yoga has been appropriated by the ego and has been diluted, commercialized, and too often diverted from its original purpose. Our approach returns to the ancient tradition of offering Darshan (direct transmission from the Source of Power), Diksha (initiation), Gyana (knowledge), and Sadhana (praxis). But we have re-engineered the process to enable you to reinforce your will power and courage to transcend the known. Our focus is on activating the capacity for immediate illumination.	\N	1	2025-11-03 13:18:07.019645
3	1	2	A Range of Processes and Non-Practice	\N	Because everyone requires an approach appropriate to their level of maturity, educational background, and conceptual intelligence, we employ a range of processes for those not ready for the ultimate non-practice of immediate Self-realization. These include not only direct encounters with our teacher (a master of dharma combat, or zen dialogue), but also individual alchemical counseling sessions with an adept mentor. The latter provide a safe space in which to uproot projections, transform emotions, and release the residue of trauma as well as attachments to obsolete thinking and behavior patterns. We also offer powerful meditation methods. Once you have tasted the ecstasy of inner silence and serenity, you will not stop short of obtaining life's grand prize. Along with that, you will know the joy of altruism, devotion, artistic expression, and embodying the paradoxical wisdom of the Avadhutas (those who live in complete freedom).	\N	2	2025-11-03 13:18:07.019646
4	2	0	The Integration of Raja Yoga and Gyana Yoga	\N	Meditation is the gradual path to Self-sovereignty (in Sanskrit, Raja Yoga). Gaining mastery over the chattering mind and scattered attention may require the use of centering techniques, of which we have many. Understanding how the ego functions may help you change its tendency to self-sabotage. That is one aspect of Gyana Yoga. For those ready to activate their crown chakra, the higher Gyana (knowledge) will do the job.	\N	0	2025-11-03 13:18:07.027574
5	2	1	Kundalini Yoga: Re-Tuning the Radio	\N	Let's face it: Nearly all of us suffer from stunted intellectual development. This is not our fault. We are products of a narcissistic and nihilistic social system that never taught us our true potential for genius. Here we offer a step-by-step process to repair the damage to our attention span, intellectual curiosity, and capacity to descend into our innermost Being in order to attune to the infinite intelligence.	\N	1	2025-11-03 13:18:07.027576
6	2	2	Bhakti Yoga: Devotion and Surrender	\N	Open your Heart! That's the simplest way to reach God-consciousness. It is a cliché to say that God is love, but it is still the Truth. The more you resonate with the all-pervading Presence—which is felt as blissful love without an object or a subject—the easier it is to let go of all contractions, delusions, and karmic symptoms.	\N	2	2025-11-03 13:18:07.027577
7	2	3	Karma Yoga: Serving the Real	\N	True service of the Real requires attunement to the Real. Karma Yoga brings poise; lightness; accurate intention and timing of action; and glitch-free relations with people, the realm of Nature, and the social order.	\N	3	2025-11-03 13:18:07.027578

In the silence between thoughts, we discover the infinite potential that has always been present.\n\n## Understanding the Nature of Mind\n\nThe mind, when properly understood, is not an obstacle but a gateway. Through meditation and self-inquiry, we begin to see through the illusions that have kept us bound.\n\n### The Practice\n\nAsk yourself: Who am I?

Residents gather in the meditation hall for morning sadhana, sitting in silence as the jungle comes alive around us.\n\n## Sacred Service (Seva)\n\nAfter breakfast, community members engage in various forms of seva - from tending the organic gardens to maintaining the ashram grounds. Every action becomes a meditation when performed with presence and devotion.\n\n## Afternoon Satsang\n\nThe highlight of each day is satsang with Shunyamurti. These profound teachings offer guidance on the spiritual path and address questions that arise in our practice.\n\n## Evening Reflection\n\nAs the sun sets over the jungle canopy, we return to meditation, integrating the day's insights and preparing for the deep rest of yoga nidra.	\N	Ashram Community	\N	5	f	t	\N	\N	\N	e16d71fb-910b-4a48-98af-eb7c1bb8e7e3	2025-10-30 14:25:16.111981+00	2025-10-30 14:25:16.049597+00	\N

This fundamental misperception colors every aspect of human experience and lies at the root of all suffering.\n\n## What is Non-Duality?\n\nNon-duality, or Advaita in Sanskrit, points to the recognition that there is only one reality. The apparent multiplicity of forms is like waves on the ocean - seemingly separate, yet never apart from the water itself.\n\n## The Path of Inquiry\n\nThe realization of non-duality is not achieved through accumulation of knowledge but through the subtraction of false beliefs. Self-inquiry dissolves the illusory sense of a separate self, revealing what has always been true.\n\n## Living the Truth\n\nWhen the illusion of separation falls away, life continues but without the burden of a false identity. Actions happen, thoughts arise, but there is no longer an imaginary entity claiming ownership of experience.	\N	Shunyamurti	\N	12	f	t	\N	\N	non-duality, advaita vedanta, consciousness, self-inquiry	44ed224d-5e8f-4673-98fc-041ebe6011c5	2025-10-30 14:25:16.228776+00	2025-10-30 14:25:16.221872+00	\N
4e7f9f0c-c04d-49fe-a013-b0664723a524	What is the True Nature of the Self?	true-nature-of-self-qa	Shunyamurti responds to a seeker's question about self-realization and the nature of consciousness.	## Question from a Seeker\n\n*Dear Shunyamurti, I have been practicing meditation for several years, but I still don't understand what the Self really is. Can you help clarify this?*\n\n## Shunyamurti's Response\n\nThe Self cannot be understood through the mind because the Self is what understands. It is the light by which everything else is known.\n\nWhen you ask "What is the Self?" you are already assuming a subject-object relationship. But the Self is not an object that can be grasped. It is the subject that can never be objectified.\n\n## Beyond Concepts\n\nEvery description of the Self is a pointer, not the truth itself. Like a finger pointing at the moon, the teaching directs your attention but is not what it points to.\n\nThe Self is what remains when all false identifications are removed. It is your true nature, prior to all concepts, prior to all experience.\n\n## The Direct Path\n\nStop seeking the Self as if it were something you don't have. Instead, recognize what is always present - the awareness that is reading these words right now. That awareness is not separate from the Self you seek.	\N	Shunyamurti	\N	6	f	t	\N	\N	\N	e097e5e1-2e3a-43cf-bbe6-72bf7f507d47	2025-10-30 14:25:16.255767+00	2025-10-30 14:25:16.250132+00	\N

True surrender is neither weakness nor resignation - it is the most radical act of freedom.\n\n## What is Real Surrender?\n\nSurrender is the recognition that the separate self has no real control. It is the letting go of the illusion that you, as an individual ego, are the doer of actions.\n\nWhen you truly surrender, you don't become nothing - you become everything. The boundaries that seemed to define you dissolve, and you recognize yourself as the infinite consciousness that permeates all existence.\n\n## Surrender and Grace\n\nGrace flows naturally when there is no resistance. The ego, with its endless desires and fears, blocks the natural flow of divine energy. Surrender opens the floodgates.\n\n## How to Practice Surrender\n\n1. Recognize the futility of egoic effort\n2. Trust in the intelligence of consciousness\n3. Let go of the need to control outcomes\n4. Remain present with what is\n5. Offer all actions as service to the divine\n\n## The Ultimate Surrender\n\nThe final surrender is the surrender of the one who surrenders. When even the act of surrendering is seen through, only truth remains.	\N	Shunyamurti	\N	7	f	t	\N	\N	\N	7adaa1ca-9c3e-42bb-b929-1583c770891d	2025-10-30 14:25:16.275961+00	2025-10-30 14:25:16.272103+00	\N

This package includes 5 audio mp3 recordings: \\n \\n Track 1: (24:22) \\n \\n In this opening teaching, Shunyamurti explains what an avadhuta is, and provides commentary on each verse, including themes of: grace, nonduality, transcending the mind, emotional equanimity, and ego transcendence, among others. \\n \\n \\n Track 2: (21:38) \\n \\n Shunyamurti continues commenting on the Avadhuta Gita, commenting on withdrawing consciousness from the sensory realm, not stopping at the Symbolic register (which is a dead-end), the paradox involved in Self-Realization, and the teleological realization that Liberation has already been chosen and you are simply pretending that you are not Liberated. \\n \\n \\n Track 3: (26:28) \\n \\n Reading from two different translations and discusses themes including: God can never be an object of knowledge; claiming/reclaiming your power (not projecting your power outside of yourself or on an other); how the Emptiness is also Fullness; the nonduality of duality and nonduality (including a mention of Achintya Bhedhabheda); the Path of Smoke and the Path of Light; and how to create Sat Yuga. \\n \\n \\n Track 4: (21:22) \\n \\n Commenting on themes such as: going beyond language and the impossibility of reaching the Self through two-valued logic; transcending the categories of time and space; and how the Atman is not reached through any process but is only realized in the here and now. \\n \\n \\n Track 5: (18:19) \\n \\n Shunyamurti concludes his readings from the Avadhuta Gita. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAny issues, questions or comments?

They offer intensity, signifiers of culture, human traditions of bonding with goodness, with the life drive, with the grace of giving. They offer manifestations of abundance, concentrations of flavor that make one come alive, simple yet multi-layered blending of color, texture, and alchemical nutrients: appropriate menus for the great banquet of life! \\n \\nRadha Ma is not into converting anyone into following some dogma about eating. She has found her own way through the miasma of disputes between feasting and fasting; vegetarians versus vegans; raw foodists versus cookers; fruitarians trumped by breatharians. This book is for people who have transcended such concerns and are more focused on the spirit in which food is cooked and eaten. Who are we that are doing the cooking? What is the Self? To Whom is the food offered? Is the meal received with gratitude? These are the core questions with which Sat Yoga is concerned. \\n \\nPraise for Radha Ma’s Recipes for a New Sat Renaissance: \\n \\n“Radha Ma’s cuisine is a miracle of exotic flavors, colors, aromas, and healthful combinations of nourishing and fulfilling foods never before known in Costa Rica. Her well-designed meals and artistically plated dishes provide an ultimate culinary experience no gourmet should miss.” \\n \\n~ Rodrigo Arias Sanchez, former Minister of the Presidency, Costa Rica, in the Oscar Arias Administration \\n \\n“Radha Ma daringly explores not only new combinations of ingredients, flavors and textures, but integrates all the senses. I didn’t know beauty, truth, and deliciousness could be eaten together.

But the consciousness is not a person, nor a body, nor a piece of matter, or even energy, and once that is understood then none of the supposed qualities—either of the material form or of the personality, the karma, the history of that person’s biography—have anything to do with you any longer. You are freed from the bondage that that identification created, that produces suffering, storms of guilt, of shame, of anxiety, of gender confusion—of all kinds of psychopathologies that result from the identification with the material vehicle that itself is only a configuration of consciousness—it’s only made of divine light, as is all of the holographic simulation.... \\n \\n[Length - 1:03:16] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

Now, the term “diamond mind” is used in Buddhism and other traditions, but I’m going to give a slightly different signification for it. At the ego level, you’ve got four basic emotions that are presentable in public that people tend to alternate: You can be sad, mad, glad, or scad. OK, scad means you’re really “scad” of something—that’s a New York accent for “scared”. . . . But that’s only the, let’s say, the visible spectrum of emotional light, if you wish. Then, you’ve got the lower and the higher parts of the diamond... \\n \\n[Length - 47:35] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

And as it gets closer to the light, its love grows in accord with its fear, and the love and the fear become one, and at some point the moth cannot live without becoming one with the flame. And in that moment that the moth enters the flame and that its wings are set on fire, and its whole body is taken over by the combustion of the flame—at that moment—just for one instant—the moth knows what it is to be the flame. But then there is only the flame, and no more moth.... \\n \\n[Length - 16:34] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

And this is what is so frustrating to the ego—because can you ever capture otherness? But is otherness real? Or is it an illusion? Is there really any otherness, except from the perspective of an illusory other? And isn’t the definition of the ego, simply consciousness captured in the gaze of an other?And therefore, liberation can only be the recognition that there is another other, in whose gaze you live. Beyond the gaze of any particular other, is the archetype of otherness itself. But can otherness ever be itself? \\n \\n[Length - 13:16] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

If you don’t have a deep love for God, you won’t enjoy meditation, and you won’t enjoy life very much—and you won’t be able to discover who you are, because the God you don’t love is your Self. The gods that the ego does love are idols that it worships that don’t bring salvation. So Rumi called out to me today and said, “Why don’t you read some of my poetry?” So, I said “OK, well you know, I can’t deny that you were, as the title of this book says, ‘Insane with Love’.” \\n \\n[Length - 13:08] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

And once that shift is made then what happens immediately is that one loses all fear, because what all fear comes down to is the fear of the other’s projection upon oneself, as being unworthy of existence. It is this fear of the projection of the other that can lead to rejection, abandonment, and all of the other existential consequences that are so terrifying to the individual ego that can only be surmounted by the recognition that there is no ego at all... \\n \\n[Length - 16:29] \\n \\n*This item is available on the Members Section.

His words transmit a higher logic of wisdom that floods the mind with awe and the heart with hope, faith and joy.

It is a masterful weaving of the most essential insights into our spiritual nature and what we must do in our embodied lives to pass through this moment into Grace.” “The Absolute Truth shines through these radiant gems, woven together with poetic prose and transmissions of divine intelligence that open the heart and awaken the soul to its true mission and purpose: to eliminate the ego and liberate consciousness from the illusion.

But it needed to be adapted to offer relevant guidance now, to help people face the challenges of the unprecedented planetary state of emergency that is underway. \\n \\nThe wisdom of the Dao delivered here by Shunyamurti is true to the spirit of Laozi, yet very practical and specific, in relation to dealing with injection mandates, lockdowns, and the extreme levels of oppression and social collapse that are occurring globally. But a much bigger picture of the meaning of these events is also provided, unveiling the core of the deepest mysteries of the nature of reality, and the trajectory of our collective destiny. \\n \\nThose who follow the Dao will be able to traverse this time of tribulations in a state of grace, become true sages, and earn the right to graduate from the school of life, by rising into cosmic consciousness. \\n \\n*The Sat Yoga wisdom school relies on the love offerings and generous contributions of our extended community. The proceeds from this book will support the free dissemination of our teachings to seekers worldwide.

But it needed to be adapted to offer relevant guidance now, to help people face the challenges of the unprecedented planetary state of emergency that is underway. \\nThe wisdom of the Dao delivered here by Shunyamurti is true to the spirit of Laozi, yet very practical and specific, in relation to dealing with injection mandates, lockdowns, and the extreme levels of oppression and social collapse that are occurring globally. But a much bigger picture of the meaning of these events is also provided, unveiling the core of the deepest mysteries of the nature of reality, and the trajectory of our collective destiny. \\nSATSANG COLLECTION \\nA Four-Part Book Group Guided by Shunyamurti \\nThese gatherings were recorded live and the audio video package is available here as a revelatory companion to the book.

The Seven Veils of Maya is the second volume in the Gems of Wisdom series. \\nIn this unique volume of essays, Shunyamurti applies Greek mythology to describe the Dao of Kundalini. This is the key to understanding how our life energy unfolds our latent psychospiritual powers through unveiling layer after layer of illusion. But this poetic text also explains the unfolding destiny of our planet. It captures the paradoxical secret of how we as a species could have reached chakra seven—the summit of our scientific and spiritual knowledge—only simultaneously with the collapse of the social order and the impending destruction of our world. Integrating the deepest ancient and modern wisdom of East and West, these writings will bring peace to the anxious heart, coherence to the mind, and courage to those souls who are willing to face the full truth of our situation. \\nDOWNLOAD YOUR FREE SAMPLE HERE \\nA Note About These Gems of Wisdom Digital Files \\nYour ebook purchase includes 3 types of files, so you can select the best format for your reading device: \\nPDF: Best version for preservation of fonts, format, and layout and can be used across most e-readers. \\nEpub: Built to view best in iBooks (Apple) and Calibre. \\nMobi: Made for Kindle apps and e-readers.

These Gems of Wisdom speak on all 7 levels and beyond to those who are willing to allow its Truth to penetrate the ego’s shell and saturate the soul with wonderful insights and awe-full truths into one’s structure and psyche. But Shunyamurti’s powerful written transmissions also carry the reminder that the path to redemption is always open and make the true reality clearer than ever." ~Vajra \\n \\n"This book reveals the bittersweet reality of egoic life and Consciousness development. Each trap reveals the stepping stone to the next phase of our lives. If the obstacle is the way, then you will find no better map to overcome every illusory construct and to finally shine, uninhibited, as the light of Supreme Reality. Thank you, Shunyamurti, for this acute insight into the human condition and the revelation of what lies beyond the veils." ~Yogiraj \\n \\n"Coming out of the magical spell of The Seven Veils, the kirtan of love for Awareness sings in this heart. I’ve been left ever more elated and light and in surrender to God. The spiritual journey mapped to its culmination in this book is remembered within—Jaya Dev in the words of Shunyamurti. I Am that I Am, in reverence and blessings to all." ~Marjiva Ma \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n	EBOOK	15.00	15.00	\N	\N	\N	https://www.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gems-Volume-2-Store-Product-Square.jpg	["https://www.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gems-Volume-2-Store-Product-Square.jpg"]		["simple", "downloadable", "virtual"]	[{"id": "d0d8b345-0f20-43cc-a724-cf544325d7f7", "name": "Gems-of-Wisdom_Volume-2_Ebook", "url": "https://www.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gems-of-Wisdom-Volume-2_The-Seven-Veils-of-Maya.zip"}]	["E-Books", "Featured", "Products"]	[]	null	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	t	f		f		2025-10-30 15:50:25.081812	2025-10-30 15:50:25.081813	10.00

The Practice of Self-Mastery \\nAll the ego-ripping paradoxes of nonduality are exposed as unbearable truth in this non-ordinary seminar filled with shocking recognitions of the Real. The utmost seriousness is united with lighthearted astonishment, as we wrap our minds around the renunciation of renunciation, the non-resistance to resistance, and the hopelessness of our non-existent character. Can you handle knowing you are an algorithmic program in a simulation designed by and for the endless entertainment of the Self, who is also yourself? Your soul wants in to the inner sanctum of wisdom and power, and wants out to the infinite sky of blissful light—and you want all this to be given in the comfort zone of your illusory identity. You want ignorance as bliss. You want your mirror image to awaken while you remain asleep. But if you were never really asleep, can you make yourself awaken? \\n \\nListen to these teachings only if you dare to have all your veils of illusion ripped away and be left with Nothing to hold onto.

The Avadhuta Revolution \\nThe Coming Victory of Divine Madness Over Artificial Intelligence \\nWe have all heard this prediction by the globalists: “You will own nothing and you will be happy.” Most people take this as a threat of total enslavement and impoverishment. Indeed, it may be meant that way. But if we understand the subtle paradoxical logic of the Mind of God (the real power underlying this world simulation), this is actually the ultimate blessing. It is a description of the state of the Avadhuta, one who has attained supreme freedom and total bliss. \\nYou are invited to discover how to fulfill the ancient human yearning for infinite intelligence and power, not through being microchipped and subsumed in the computer cloud, but by joining this expansive noetic movement of transcendence of ego and entering into the glorious light of Absolute Spirit. Let us not only celebrate the coming of the Avadhutas: Be among the first to join the ranks of the truly free, by focusing on the rigorous practice necessary to shed the ego and attain the Supreme Realization in the shortest time possible. \\n \\nWherever your body may be, your soul can be centered in the unmanifest Self. This is the moment to break free of the matrix and gain the infinite wealth of ultimate reality! \\n \\nComplete set of 8 class recordings available as video and audio mp3, and 5 guided meditations available in mp3 format: \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n 11 hours of video and audio content \\n 4 powerful guided meditations \\n 3 Morning wisdom classes, 1 midday seminar, and 4 evening satsangs \\n 5 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Session 1 – Shake Off All Your Constructs and Let the Self Be Revealed!

In this retreat, Shunyamurti unveils the deep secret of clear thinking that leads to the realization of the Truth of our Supreme Beingness. Dialectical and Archetypal thought can be deployed to break through the symbolic barrier and attain the eternal Real beyond thought.We can redeem our consciousness from the illusion of suffering by returning to our immortal Essence. To accomplish that, we must overcome the reign of thought and realize the Supreme Knowledge of the Heart that is revealed once the ego mind is silenced and all agitation is stilled.

But to attune to the clear light, peace, and wisdom of the fully awakened Self, the soul must use all its remaining power of agency to accomplish an act of decisive renunciation of the ego. This alchemical purification process is the essence of all the spiritual practices and can only be attained in the state that yogis refer to as sahaja samadhi. This retreat focuses on that attainment.Once purchased, you will receive a PDF guide that includes the link and password to the retreat website, where you will be able to watch all the classes, and listen to and download the audio.Complete set of five class recordings available as video and audio mp3, and 5 guided meditations available in mp3 format:This complete retreat package includes:Over 4 hours of video and audio content5 powerful guided meditationsTwo morning teachings, a midday seminar and two evening satsangs3 Question and Answer Sessions with ShunyamurtiTable of Contents of this Retreat:Session 1 – From Chaos to Coherence: The Time of the Concept is Over [1:08:35]Session 2 – Sat Yoga is the Re-Unification with the Whole of Consciousness [28:13]Session 3 – Self-Acceptance and Self-Discovery Guided Exercise [1:13:14]Session 4 – Guided Meditation and Q&A Session with Shunyamurti [1:32:01]Session 5 – Welcome the Self in an Ultra-Marriage Consummation of Love [17:36]Any issues, questions or comments?

The Great Escape: \\nA New Path Out of the Prison of the Ego \\nHuman consciousness constructs a prison around itself in the form of a disappointing world; a failed self-image; and an incoherent perspective on reality based in cognitive biases, paranoia, anxiety, narcissistic delusion, and wishful thinking. Consciousness is tortured in its ego prison, yet escape seems impossible. The censoring warden, the superego guards, the electrified fence of anxiety, the terror of madness and death, all function to keep the sentient being paralyzed in its condition of ignorance. Furthermore, the seeming indispensability of ego defenses and our penchant for settling for small, self-defeating escapes into sensory gratification and short-lived altered states at the expense of making the Great Escape beyond the ego, all tend to produce futility and despair. \\n \\nIn this extraordinary seminar, the ego and its logic are explained and deconstructed. The qualities of heroic courage, clear reasoning, love of the infinite, and capacity for deep recognition of the Real are all explored as tunnels out of the ego’s penitentiary. The core obstacle is greed. Applying spiritual aikido, it is suggested that we not try to fight against our inherent greed as egos, but instead expand our greed to infinite magnitude. Be greedy for infinite creative intelligence, measureless and endless joy, immortality, omnipotence, and perfection. To contain all that, of course, the ego mind must be emptied out and opened to all-encompassing presence and inconceivable potency. Focusing on realizing the ungraspable totality of the Real allows the paradoxical nature of consciousness to be revealed and the Truth beyond thought to become recognized as the Self. Join us for this daring escape from the illusory ego and the full enjoyment of the freedom of our Eternal Essence! \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of four class recordings available as video and audio mp3s, and four guided meditations available in mp3 format. \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n Over 4 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 4 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 1 Morning Teaching \\n 1 Midday Seminar \\n 2 Evening Satsangs \\n 2 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n 1 Bonus Teaching given just after the retreat on November, 15, 2023 \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Class 1 – The Great Escape (from the Ego) [1:22:45] \\n Class 2 – The Dharma of Infinite Greed [1:09:02] \\n Class 3 – You Are an Artifact of Your Own Imagination [1:24:18] \\n Class 4 – There is No Escape from Freedom [29:50] \\n Bonus Teaching – The Secret of the Marvelous Enlightenment [17:06] \\n \\n \\n \\nAny issues, questions, or comments?

This is the moment—at the end of this Kali Yuga—that is destined for that ultimate descent of grace to those of us who yearn for that sublime absorption of our soul into the energy field of the Divine Presence. In this retreat, we are guided to understand how to prepare for—and trigger—that supreme event. \\n \\nBy offering us a detailed picture of the micro-moments of the unfoldment of consciousness from Pure Awareness to a fixed ego identity, these teachings help us to retrace that process back to the point of origin. Making use of practical exercises and guided meditations, we are led through the portal of Presence into the infinite expanse of luminous ecstatic intelligence that is the Mind of God. \\n \\nExperience the delight of tasting the Nectar of Immortality as all your prior beliefs about reality are exploded in a flood of new knowledge! Once you grok how your mind really functions (and malfunctions), you will be able to transcend the ego and abide in the illumined soul … and then—if you let go of all worldly attachments—merge into the Absolute Self.

The Recipe for Rapture: \\nWhy the World Must Now Be Sacrificed \\nThe history of societies reveals two important kinds of intervention that were employed to maintain harmony among the members—or at least return the group to peaceful relationships once they reached the edge of chaos. The institution of proxy sacrifice has been the most common device. In this kind of social order, once greed, competition, and deadly rivalry reached levels of contagious violence that threatened to tear apart the entire tribe or city-state, a scapegoat was found and ritually executed. This bloodshed would usually appease the general agitation and renew stability for a time. The theory of mimetic desire developed by René Girard explains this mechanism quite accurately. \\n \\nBut a few societies developed a much more spiritually elegant solution. This was the brilliant creation and general role-modeling of the attainment of the ideal of self-sacrifice. The first historical example of this comes from the ancient Vedic culture that flourished many thousands of years ago. In the West, this has been the aspiration of Christian sages ever since their founder was murdered for teaching exactly that. The widespread emulation of Christ was hoped to propagate a morality of nonviolence and ego sacrifice. The failure of this effort has brought the world to its current state on the edge of global self-destruction of our species. \\n \\nThe spiritual solution to this imminent catastrophe must be sought. Sat Yoga offers a new approach by diving to the deep root of the meaning of world sacrifice—and mapping the nuances and chokepoints of the spiritual process of divinization on the individual level. \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of four class recordings available as video and audio mp3s, and four guided meditations available in mp3 format. \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n 4 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 4 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 1 Morning Teaching \\n 1 Midday Seminar \\n 2 Evening Satsangs \\n 2 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Class 1 – Recipe for Rapture: Obey the Law of Love [1:13:27] \\n Class 2 – The Paradox of Desire in a Dying World [1:07:58] \\n Class 3 – The Three Languages of the Three Modes of Time [1:09:07] \\n Class 4 – Behold the Fractal Cinematic Self-Portrait of God [18:30] \\n \\n \\n \\nAny issues, questions, or comments?

Shunyamurti’s talks are full of bombshells and astonishing insights. \\n \\nHumans at a collective level suffer from three types of ignorance. We have amnesia about our true history; we have lost our symbolic competence; and we are clueless as to our own real nature. \\n \\nNot only is all this clearly explained, but several extremely powerful visualization exercises are taught to help overcome these failings—including an advanced exercise in which we practice the optimal way to leave the body at the moment of death. \\n \\nWe are treated not only to a feast of heart-healing metaphysical revelations, but to some unrestrained speculations about our near future fate that have immediate political, social, and personal implications. Once you have listened to the teachings of this momentous seminar, the veils of ignorance will fall away—and bring you face to face with the naked Truth. \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of eight class recordings available as video and audio mp3, together with eight guided meditations available in mp3 format \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n 7 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 8 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 1 Morning Teaching, 3 Midday Seminars and 4 Evening Satsangs \\n 4 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Session 1 – New Dawn, New Spring, New Consciousness [1:00:07] \\n Session 2 – The New Gospel of Death [51:57] \\n Session 3 – Beyond Every Frame of Reference Abides the Inconceivable Self [1:06:14] \\n Session 4 – When Your Christ-Self Rises, Tyranny Will End!

All's Well That Ends Well: \\nThe Re-marriage of Shakti and Shiva \\nThe eight satsangs of this extraordinary plunge into ultimate reality will take you on a stunning voyage of God-realization from which your ego may never return.

These ego-dissolving teachings are accompanied by guided meditations that bring the insights alive as the subtle field of energy and presence palpably pervade our consciousness with power! \\n \\nWe are given many questions and points to reflect upon, that will bring you to want to replay many times these awesome talks and zen dialogues.

We take a deep dive into the concept of framing (including an analysis of Jacques Lacan’s last and little-known teaching) to learn why and how most of us today have been badly framed, producing excess suffering, psychological instability, and cognitive deadlock. From there, we explore how the mind/world binary is structured like a Mandelbrot Set, and what the implications of that are. We then move on to reframe Nikola Tesla’s understanding of the fundamental principles of reality. This reveals the pathway to unframe our consciousness and regain Total Presence. In the next stage, we go East to retrieve some of the forgotten Zen teachings that indicate how a sage’s mind really works. \\n \\nOn Easter Sunday, we reflect on an extraordinarily relevant early version of Christianity—later deemed heretical—that dovetails perfectly with modern theories of physics, and explains paranormal events as well. Only after all that prologue, are we ready to confront the really profound paradoxes that must be integrated for the mind to surrender to the Supreme Real. The dynamic dissipative structure of the ego was never more clearly explained. The grand finale hurls us in a breathtaking dialectical leap across the Abyss of Emptiness to the blissful Light of Infinite Intelligence. All these teachings are accompanied by guided meditations that drop us into the innermost depths of Being to realize That to which the awesome teachings are pointing. This seminar is a must for every serious seeker. \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of seven class recordings available as video and audio mp3, together with six guided meditations available in mp3 format \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n Over 8 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 6 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 3 Midday Seminars and 4 Evening Satsangs \\n 6 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Session 1 – You've Been Badly Framed--Or So You Believe!

It begins with a deep exploration of how and why human civilization is now being destroyed. We learn that the world’s wounds start from within our own divided consciousness. We are then introduced to a new understanding of our suffering, based on a profound concept called the Attis Complex, based on the ancient myth of Attis and Cybele. \\n \\nOur rite of passage, guided by Shunyamurti, then helps us undo our unfortunate collective repression of death, which is behind the return of the repressed as a global death drive. The journey takes us to an extraordinary interpretation of the famous Cheshire Cat, which explains why we are so embedded in delusion and think it is normal. There is no greater gift than receiving a God’s-eye-view of this dying dream field—even though the full Presence of God is intolerable to the ego, which would instantly dissolve if it starts to resonate with that supreme vibrational frequency. \\n \\nIn Act Two of the retreat, we learn The Art of the Ordeal. We must come to terms with the suffering that has become an inevitable part of life, and more importantly, we learn how to overcome it. Here it is the Osiris Complex that comes to our aid. The journey then takes us into the heart of quantum physics, and the rude awakening that science has brought to us: that the world is unreal. Not only is matter a fictional category, but both space and time are illusory. The spiritual significance of all this is immense. The teaching concludes with a convergence of science with postmodern philosophy, ancient tribal wisdom, and the Eastern teachings of nonduality. \\n \\nIn the final act of our sacred gathering, we learn how to leapfrog all our existential ordeals, and immediately transport our souls into the blissful light of eternal Presence. This can be achieved through reason alone, if our minds are coherent enough, but our chances greatly improve if our hearts are open and there is love for the Infinite Intelligence from Whom we derive our Being. If you take in these teachings and reflect on them seriously, that is all you need to attain Liberation in Life. \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of seven class recordings available as video and audio mp3, together with six guided meditations available in mp3 format \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n Over 4 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 3 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 1 Midday Seminars and 2 Evening Satsangs \\n 3 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Session 1 – The Rite of Passage: From Hopeless to Hilarious [1:12:13] \\n Session 2 – The Art of the Ordeal [1:07:48] \\n Session 3 – There is No Ordeal in the Real [1:15:51] \\n \\n \\n \\nAny issues, questions or comments?

An Invitation to Sustained Serenity	Complete Audio-Video Retreat Teachings Package \\nAfter purchase, you will receive a PDF guide that includes the link and password to the retreat website, where you will be able to watch all the classes and listen to and download the audio. \\n	Live Free of Anxiety! \\nAn Invitation to Sustained Serenity \\nNearly everyone alive today is plagued—either consciously or subconsciously—by chronic anxiety that can flare up with even a slight increase in stress. The defenses that most people develop to cope with, or repress anxiety, can cause much worse conditions to appear. Since the world is becoming a more stressful place every day, as wars, economic and social collapse symptoms, and natural disasters, all exponentially proliferate, this retreat is extremely relevant and timely. \\n \\nShunyamurti offers a new understanding of the roots of anxiety that gets directly to the core of this tormenting phenomenon. It is both simple and mind-boggling. Then, he proceeds to deliver the remedy. This, too, is simple—although it does take courage to face the hidden truth. What makes this possible is the picture Shunyamurti paints quite poetically about the Beyond of anxiety—and that he shows us through his own presence and demeanor. What is amazing is that anxiety is based on an elementary misunderstanding, and once it is clarified, one’s unease completely disappears. \\n \\nThe overcoming of anxiety brings many great rewards, including wisdom, compassion, freedom to develop our untapped potential, and to live in unimaginable fulfillment. Why wait until your anxiety levels get out of control before learning and applying the secrets revealed in this extraordinary brief seminar? There is also no better gift that you could offer to a loved one than a copy of this astonishing teaching. \\n \\n \\n \\nComplete set of seven class recordings available as video and audio mp3, together with six guided meditations available in mp3 format \\n \\nThis complete retreat package includes: \\n \\n Over 4 Hours of Video and Audio Content \\n 3 Powerful Guided Meditations \\n 1 Midday Seminars and 2 Evening Satsangs \\n 2 Question and Answer Sessions with Shunyamurti \\n \\n \\n \\nTable of Contents of this Retreat: \\n \\n Session 1 – Drop the Xanax and Pick Up the Zen Axe!

In this retreat, we will help you pry open your third eyelid—so you can enjoy the healing laughter of your liberated heart."]	This 3-Day Online Retreat Includes:	["<strong>Livestream Satsangs with Shunyamurti:</strong> Three, 90-minute Livestream Satsangs including Wisdom Classes, Guided Meditations, and Question and Answer Sessions", "<strong>Early Morning Meditation:</strong> Meditate with the Sat Yoga Sangha Live via Zoom", "<strong>Encounter Group:</strong> Connect with Senior Sat Yogis Live via Zoom", "<strong>Asanas:</strong> Yoga Asana Practice Live via Zoom", "<strong>Retreat Portal:</strong> Access your transformational journey through our beautifully designed Retreat Portal, directly available from your personal dashboard.

20	20	\N	What is Sat Yoga?	\N	\N	\N	\N	The ancient Sanskrit term Sat refers to what is absolutely Real and thus implicitly imperishable. The term Yoga means union, or realization of oneness. To live in oneness with the eternally present Absolute Real is both the way and the goal of Sat Yoga.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120%	\N	2025-11-03 13:18:07.017673	2025-11-03 13:18:07.017677

22	22	\N	Atmanology: Beyond Psychology	\N	\N	["The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120%	\N	2025-11-03 13:18:07.030409	2025-11-03 13:18:07.030411

To fully heal from the wounds of egoic consciousness and become receptive to transmission of the Supreme Light of Being requires surrender to a higher will and to the support of a spiritual community.", "Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.", "Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity."]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120%	\N	2025-11-03 13:44:57.117333	2025-11-03 13:44:57.117336

We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.", "We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.", "The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.", "We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required."]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"nataraj": {"image": "/nataraj.png", "mobile": {"top": "265px", "left": "-150px", "width": "560px", "height": "700px", "zIndex": 0, "opacity": 0.06}, "desktop": {"top": "250px", "left": "-200px", "width": "670px", "height": "670px", "zIndex": 0, "opacity": 0.1}}}	2025-11-03 13:18:13.999856	2025-11-03 13:18:13.99986

We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.", "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.", "Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings."]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-11-03 13:18:14.006781	2025-11-03 13:18:14.006783

32	32	\N	What is Shunyamurti?	\N	\N	["To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means \\"empty,\\" while murti means \\"form.\\" In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source."]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120%	\N	2025-11-03 13:18:20.593433	2025-11-03 13:18:20.593435

As a child, he would spend afternoons outdoors contemplating and writing poetry. This led to reading classic poetry and discovering the world of literature. He was active in sports, especially martial arts such as judo and aikido. Political consciousness awakened with the news of the murder of President Kennedy. He became an activist opposing the U.S. war in Vietnam, and that brought him to study Gandhi, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Upanishads—which explained his own inner states. His search culminated in the discovery of the books of Sri Ramana Maharshi, who most clearly exemplified the eternal Truths. By then, no doubt remained."]}, {"heading": "Encountering Baba Hari Dass", "paragraphs": ["The fullness of life in that period inevitably included abundant experimentation with psychedelics, hitchhiking adventures to many parts of the country and later the world, meeting leading figures in the avant-garde, and participating in some extraordinary events. The most profound experience was encountering Baba Hari Dass. The presence of that shining being brought to Shunyamurti overwhelming love and a long period of discipleship."]}, {"heading": "Journey from Worldly to Otherworldly", "paragraphs": ["After graduating from university with a double major in philosophy and drama and a minor in literature, Shunyamurti became the director of an international book club in New York City focused on insightful analyses of current issues in geopolitics. Eventually, he earned a law degree and a psychology doctorate. The practice of law was stultifying, but worthwhile because it satisfied his interest in cosmic law (to structure future human interactions with extraterrestrial visitors), karmic law, and the genuine worldly wisdom hidden at the heart of our degraded legal systems—plus, it taught him first-hand how the system worked."]}, {"heading": "A Passage to India", "paragraphs": ["He was rescued from a career as an attorney during a fervent solitary meditation retreat. The Great Spirit abducted him. An encounter with a teacher from India led to a pilgrimage in that land. Immersed in the exquisite divine energy field of an ashram, Shunyamurti bathed for ten years in that holy river of Gyana and Shakti, becoming a devoted yogi. Then, he received new marching orders from within: learn Western approaches to soul healing and become adept in offering help."]}, {"heading": "Hypnosis and Beyond", "paragraphs": ["After studying hypnotherapy, he began a private practice. He also took graduate courses in psychology at night and on weekends.", "A flourishing practice of transformational healing unfolded, evolving from Ericksonian hypnotherapy to past-life regression, to spirit de-possession, to ghost-busting at haunted houses, to working with people who had been captured and released by aliens, to removing curses imposed by practitioners of black magic, and even to being psychically attacked by those dark forces in revenge. He learned a great deal about the world of the occult and the paranormal."]}, {"heading": "But then ...", "paragraphs": ["But then, a very different immersion in psychoanalysis training—first Kleinian, then Lacanian—led Shunyamurti to a critical reappraisal of the role of such a focus on the paranormal, transforming his shamanic level of work to a higher spiritual level. He came to see that the subconscious had to be countervailed by the Superconscious, and those pivotal insights concerned the use of Kundalini energy. After correcting the psychoanalytic map of the structure of the ego and learning the language of dreams, the function was to abide in the Absolute.", "The rest is the story of the sangha, the ashram, and the miracles of our Lord.

62	62	\N	Our Patron (and Matron) Sages	\N	\N	\N	\N	The star exemplar of liberation in life in modern times is Sri Ramana Maharshi, who transcended the ego illusion in one afternoon at the age of sixteen and who, without intention, became a world teacher. We admire as well all the recent spiritual geniuses of India, including Ananda Mayi Ma, Yogananda, Swami Lakshmanjoo, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Nisargadatta. The Buddha Dharma is also appreciated and studied here. We learn from the great Christian mystics and their hesychasm and via negativa. We revel in the fiery drunkenness of the wild poetic Sufis and learn (and laugh at) the antics of trickster sages from the Daoist and Zen lineages, not to mention the fascinating formulations of the Hermeticists and Alchemists. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers—from Pythagoras and Parmenides to the Stoics and neo-Platonists—have also left us jewels of practical wisdom. Last but not least, important insights into consciousness and the Real have been discovered by scientists and delivered by recent paradigm-shifting thinkers. We distill and assimilate all of that.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[{"alt": "Sri Ramana Maharshi", "src": "/xatronsage1.png", "name": "Sri Ramana Maharshi"}, {"alt": "Anandamayi Ma", "src": "/xatronsage2.png", "name": "Anandamayi Ma"}, {"alt": "Nisargadatta Maharaj", "src": "/xatronsage3.png", "name": "Nisargadatta Maharaj"}, {"alt": "Swami Lakshman Joo", "src": "/xatronsage4.png", "name": "Swami Lakshman Joo"}]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

80c49064-9d6b-4d7d-8072-d2f242d20cc5	western-mind-gita	How the Western Mind Bent the Bhagavad Gita	According to the Jewish tradition, we are in the High Holy Days. According to the news, we are in the lowest unholy days. Both are true. As global tensions escalate, this paradox points directly to the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita: The war to be concerned with is the inner battle between your ego and your soul. The Gita has inspired much of modern Western philosophy—from Schopenhauer and Hegel to Nietzsche and beyond—yet none of those thinkers got the real message being transmitted. Accurate understanding of the Gita’s profound instructions is essential now for physical survival in this time of tribulation and, more importantly, for spiritual salvation.	videoandaudio	preview	10	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/09/Members-Section-Gyani-Bonus_250926_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	1234	2025-09-27 17:47:56	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.005719	2025-11-04 11:12:10.852662	["1d4ef8a21cb7e237fd05cb71ac35fec5"]	["dxj66-1978ba3-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

God-consciousness will soon replace ego-consciousness. We are immortal and eternal in our true nature. There is nothing to fear in this transition.

(This is intended to accompany the recipe for Post-Persian Pilaf being currently offered by Radha’s Kitchen—but the two can be enjoyed separately.)	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	Recipe for Liberation:Post-Person Peel-OffThe recipe for liberation offered this month at Shunya’s Kitchen is Post-Person Peel-Off. (This is intended to accompany the recipe for Post-Persian Pilaf being currently offered by Radha’s Kitchen—but the two can be enjoyed separately.)To begin, the “Person” must be heated to boiling in a hermetically sealed vessel, with proper atmanological containment. The pseudo-individual must experience several hysterical events, until it recognizes its delusional status and its self-defeating false will falls away from the inside out.This gutting process can be augmented through the application of intensive tapasya, producing gradual ego-mind dissolution, though this may require a large pressure cooker of many individual sessions.The heat can be turned up by directing powerful Shakti microwaves at the Person’s internal censor. This will produce radiant heat in the pith of the softening ahamkar (the narcissistic loin material), while the ongoing manas activity is repeatedly chopped by a witnessing zen master’s Buddha-mind. This purification can be further intensified through pungent mahavakya seasoning and direct drishti.The Person’s tendencies, attitudes, and resistances to surrender must be pounded until the fragrance of divine love can be perceived. The thick husks of hatred, dominance, and demand must be shelled, and the inner membrane of self-hatred, lack and anxiety must also be peeled away. This can happen most effectively when the Person is dropped into a spiritual community and stirred with dharma, vows, transparency, and stabilized through inability to distract or project or move into fight-or-flight mode.Once the inedible Person has been peeled off successfully, and both body and mind have been detached from the identity, then the more subtle processes of shredding, compacting, molding, and baking should ensue.The post-person’s essence must be thoroughly dried, with all excess sentimentality removed. Be sure that all traces of passion, desire, and fear have been smoked out over an open flame of a well-attended yagya. By eliminating all externalization, the post-person’s consciousness is compacted into a one-pointed mass of empowered luminous presence.Finally, through ongoing satsangs and consistent teachings, all sense of a world, time, action, and multiplicity are flaked off. In the last procedure, even the sense of God is dissolved. What remains is uncreated, eternal, and shining with bliss.The post-person peel-off is baked until hardened to the consistency of diamond flecked with rainbow light, and served in a brilliant lotus flower floating in a sea of nectar of immortality.This recipe will serve an unlimited number and can be offered repeatedly. Just re-heat with meditation. It will never go bad.Namaste from Shunya’s Kitchen.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming Obstacles	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 12:06:01	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.372003	2025-10-28 15:31:24.372003	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

To be most effective, Gyana Yoga must be integrated with the other six essential yogas that comprise the heart of the Sat Yoga approach. But those with clarity, determination, and devotion—those who have had what in Zen is called kensho, the living recognition of the presence and true nature of the Absolute, can reach jivan mukti solely on the basis of this practice of Ashtanga Gyana Yoga.Those with sufficient Shakti to maintain focus on the inner presence of Shiva until all the sanskaras of distraction have melted away will discover through this simple practice that luminous bliss is our real Being and always has been and will be eternally.The eight limbs of Gyana Yoga are as follows:1. Yama—this is the initial resolve to control the urges toward sensory gratification through the recognition that the realm of the senses is a mirage that will never bring lasting satisfaction and that the pursuit of sensuous pleasure—even when under the aegis of love—always ends in greater bondage, suffering, and despair. The Gyana Yamas are made up of the following elements:• Ahimsa—which refers in this yoga to the refusal to violently break off, through forgetfulness, one’s connection with the Supreme Self.• Satya—means always living and acting as the incorporeal Self in true consciousness and with ultimate responsibility;• Asteya—means the refusal to steal the great treasure from others, by seeing all as manifestations of the one Self, and treating all with honor.• Brahmacharya—this means dwelling with Brahman, the Absolute, and in practice making the consistent choice to live in wholeness and purity, free of egoic identifications.• Aparigraha—this vow of non-possession means not to be possessed by any projections of others nor to possess any negative feelings or thoughts or harbor any ill will toward anyone. To be free of possessions is to be free of ego, free of thoughts, and free of vexations.2. Niyama—in the words of Sri Ramana, this means “maintaining a stream of mental modes that relate to the Self and rejecting contrary modes. In other words, it means love that arises uninterruptedly for the Supreme Self.” It is made up of the following elements:• Shaucha—purity of heart, longing only for the inner presence of God.• Santosha—the contentment that comes from the fact of being filled by the Supreme One with power, joy, love, wisdom, and unbroken peace.• Tapas—the austerity that is really awe-stare-at-Thee, the sense of awe that comes from the third eye’s staring at the awesome supernal light of the inner Self that is the Source of awareness itself.• Swadhyaya—this is the study of sacred texts, in this case the recognition that Nature is the ultimate sacred text, and that the Nature of God is the ultimate passage in that text.• Ishwara pranidhana—this means devotion to God, especially in the form of generosity, the offering of one’s life to the Source, Who appears as Nature, Humanity, Community, Life, Being, Nothingness, Beauty, and Silence.3. Asana—in the path of Gyana Yoga, asanas refer to postures of the mind; the practice of holding specific sublime thoughts and feeling states for extended periods of time; and of stretching oneself to be greater and more egoless, mature, patient, and compassionate than one may have thought possible.4. Pranayama—this refers to the metaphoric breathing out of maya, of belief in the unreal, including name and form, attachments, opinions, judgments, desires, fears, complexes like inferiority, superiority, guilt, envy, and anger. Then one breathes in Sat, Chit, and Ananda, the outer attributes of the Supreme Real. And finally one learns to retain the innermost Real alone as one’s true nature and stay filled with that pure energy.5. Pratyahara—As Ramana says, “This is preventing name and form which have been removed from re-entering the mind.” This is the consistent practice of controlling the mind, re-training the mental habits to spontaneously sustain the peace and silence of inwardness and God-realization.6. Dharana—The sage of Arunachala teaches us that real dharana, or one-pointed concentration, is the practice of remaining centered in the Heart, in our Supreme Beingness, wordless pure intelligence, and the bliss of utter surrender and immersion in the infinite presence of Shiva.7. Dhyana—This is the completion of the act of Self-enquiry, in which one realizes in the timeless Now the answer to the question ‘Who am I?’ and consciousness remains stable in the ultimate purity of non-objectifying boundless Presence, shining as the Supreme Self.8. Samadhi—The culmination of the path of Ashtanga Gyana Yoga is the falling away even of the sense of I as the Supreme. There is only the indescribable Real, without any cognition separate from That. All dualities have been resolved. There is only the Absolute Knowledge, which is the Shunyata that transcends knowing, and is forever without a knower or a known.The paradox of the path of Gyana Yoga is not only that knowledge ends in non-conceptual awareness, but in that fact that all useful conceptualizing activities of the mind continue as usual, and are unaffected by the realization of the trans-conceptual Self. The mental activities are recognized as waves of the Ocean of Pure Consciousness, and those waves no longer create attachments, identifications, or disturbances for the Ocean. All the waves do their waving spontaneously and as emanations of purity of love and offerings of wisdom and healing.Through this essential yoga of knowledge, the world as a whole can be healed of delusions and consequent sufferings. The interconnectedness of all nodes of consciousness means that all beings everywhere are instantaneously informed of the realization of the Supreme Self by any other apparent being. This is therefore the greatest help that can be offered to the Universe.May you become such great charitable beings that you follow in the footsteps of Sri Ramana, and offer the gift of Gyana—whether called the Buddha-mind, or the Christ Consciousness, or by any other name, which is simply the gift of God-Self realization—to all sentient beings. This shall soon bring about on our planet a new age of supreme beauty, ecological restoration, goodness, wisdom, and love.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nPhilosophyYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 11:02:55	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.373505	2025-10-28 15:31:24.373505	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

These strategies may seem to offer relief, but ultimately they deepen suffering and block the path to liberation.

In this urgent satsang, Shunyamurti shares that he received the message that we are at the moment depicted in the Bhagavad Gita, when Arjuna understands and accepts that he must fight the battle he dreads, knowing it will destroy civilization. Reflecting on the aftermath of the failed Putin–Trump summit in Alaska, in the context of the imminent collapse of Western hegemony, and the fractal nature of reality—meaning that all of us face such a situation in our own lives as well— Shunya explains that the only solution is taking refuge with God. The grace of the Supreme Self alone will enable us to face fearlessly the events to come. Our spiritual duty is to radiate the salvific light of truth, peace, and divine love to all souls in our dying world.	videoandaudio	preview	30	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/08/Sat-Aug-23-MEMBERS-250822_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.jpg	3782	2025-08-23 16:28:24	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.955427	2025-11-04 11:12:13.158035	["847a0e7ea0e815587311d3d840f66469"]	["cgdb4-1940ab1-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

He maps seven micro moments—from the instant of naked presence to the reinstallation of ego identity—showing how awareness of these stages gives you the power to shift your trajectory in real time. In the “between,” where thought has not yet fixed who you are or how you see the world, lies your greatest freedom. By remaining in pure presence, you open the door to Infinite Intelligence, creative genius, and your true nature.	videoandaudio	preview	30	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/08/Fri-Aug-22-MEMBERS-231230_Attuning_Maha_Sukha_Midday-GM-Teaching.png	3518	2025-08-29 12:39:06	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.954556	2025-11-04 11:12:14.430398	["c8d7ba2af838ed3f4c812e3c40ebca9a"]	["762xp-19303a0-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is now widely recognized in the fields of medicine and psychology that meditation is a powerful instrument for the management of stress, the strengthening of the immune system, and for the acceleration of healing processes in the body. Many clinical studies have validated the effectiveness of meditation not only for physical healing and the diminution of anxiety, but for the improvement of the quality of life. The sense of happiness and inner contentment has been correlated to the capacity to meditate and sustain states of serenity and stillness. But for the Sat Yogi, meditation implies a great deal more than that.	text	free	0	\N	\N	The Unreality of the World: A Fascinating Enigma!Transmitted through ShunyamurtiNow that a Nobel Prize in Physics has been given to researchers who concluded that the cosmos is not locally real, the question of what is reality has received an important new profile, a new relevance, given the very radical initial parameters of thought now available. Let us take a dive into the depths of the inconceivable Real. But be prepared: There is no return.What the physicists mean by declaring the universe is unreal is that when particles are not observed, they do not exist as such, but only as probability waves, or wave functions. This fact is then extrapolated to all particles that make up all material objects—and to reduce them to objects of consciousness.Consciousness, however, is not physical. It cannot become an object. It is only that which observes and reasons about what is observed. But since all scientific observations are motivated by a specific kind of curiosity and desire, it is important to add that all observations are likewise primarily the expressions of desire. Desire, in turn, projects the object that it seeks. So, the unreality of the world takes the status of a dream, or a field of dreams. Thus, the import of the Nobel Prize is the recognition that the field of physics itself has morphed into the study of the non-physical.But we are still in the shallows at this point. We must take several further steps down into the fathomless abyss, with no guarantee that we can stop our freefall anywhere.The next step is to recognize that physicists have also discovered that neither space nor time is fundamentally real. This further confirms the sense that the flux of appearances is a holographic illusion, a simulation, or a dream. But because it is all an appearance in consciousness, then the question becomes: Whose consciousness is dreaming us?In other words, the particle would not exist if the physicist were not there to want to observe it. But also, the physicist would not exist if he were not observed, since he is a material object in the simulation as well. Do we keep each other in existence by observing one another? The ego probably does believe that at a deep level, which is the reason for its underlying anxiety, and its need to be seen and desired.Since consciousness experiences not only a world of particles and electromagnetic waves, but an astonishing panorama of colors, forms, systems, events, textures, tastes, sounds, feelings, and an extraordinary palette of different possibilities, intensities, durations, and saturations, we must accept that the physicists are imperience-blind, in the sense that they can measure the phenomena of experience quantitatively, but they do not recognize that the subjective, qualitative dimension of their experience—or what yogis call imperience—is far more real than the mathematically-configured model of an external world that they assume that they inhabit. But the inhabitants of an unreal world cannot be considered to have any reality, can they? Therefore, they cannot be the true observers. Who, then, is the Dreamer of this mysterious dream world?Someone recently posed an objection to the conclusion of the physicists that the world is unreal, with the following example: If you are running outside on a dark night, you can easily stub your toe on a rock or a log that you did not observe. So, its appearance did not depend on a prior observation.True enough. I am not sure how the physicists would respond to that. But the Christian minister and philosopher George Berkeley’s reply was that God is the real observer. However, to avoid excess hypotheses, we can say simply that consciousness observes all, and in fact projects all, as an expression of its own freedom of creativity. No other god or power is required. Consciousness is all that can ever be known—and known only by itself, for itself, in itself, and as itself.Now we can drop into another level of the fractal, and recognize that the situation can be nuanced much further. Let us start by noticing how wondrous is the world, and thus that it is clear that consciousness contains infinite potentiality. But different persons have different levels and qualities of consciousness. There are sages, saints, geniuses, and heroes, and there are criminals and fools. Each being chooses the level of consciousness they want to reside in, choosing among so many different flavors, styles, and levels of potency, intelligence, creativity, joy, and purity of attitude—ranging from demonic to angelic and in resonance with the Supreme Self—which vibrate as different strata of consciousness.We also know from the findings of psychoanalysis—consisting of 125 years of research by multiple trained observers of the movements of consciousness—that what we could call ego-consciousness is just a tiny sliver of our total consciousness.The Freudians focused only on the repressed subconscious levels of the mind. They also had to theorize an agency of what we could call ultra-consciousness, that Freud at one point called the Censor. This internal intelligence agency decides what can be recognized and willed, and which ideas, drives, fantasies, and other mental phenomena have to remain repressed. It also determines what can be taken into consciousness and retained, and what must be forgotten, avoided, or misunderstood. It is necessary to add that many subconscious fantasies may harbor an urge to hurt oneself. That will somehow always get expressed. That is what Freud called the return of the repressed.So, it may be that the body in our counter-example was consciously focused on running, while the subconscious was projecting a rock that would cause pain—which gave enjoyment to a superego fragment abiding in the underworld.The Jungians parted company with the Freudians, because Jung activated his upper death drive and courageously looked both downward and upward, to envision the activity of a superconscious, archetypal level of mind, that is also intervening in actual events, causing synchronicities and other paranormal phenomena.And, of course, the ancient yogis, followed later by siddhas, avadhutas, prophets, divinized shamans, and great saints, ascended even further—in some cases to the highest vibrational frequencies encompassing total consciousness. Their findings have become inscribed in what are revered as sacred texts.There is no ego at that level, no language, no thought, no world. The Absolute Dreamer of this cosmic dream cannot even be imagined, except through mythopoetic discourse that is bound to be misunderstood and misconstrued, not only because of the ego’s lack of maturity, intelligence, and depth, but because of the ego’s appropriation of language to serve its will to power.Every level of consciousness will serve its own ultimate concern, and take that for its truth. But because the ego is a crazy quilt of fragments that vibrate in a wide spectrum of frequencies, there are always conflicting drives and thus, incoherence and self-sabotage. The Censor cannot hold the center. Sooner or later, the ego comes apart. In the same way, families come apart, societies and nations self-destruct, and now the entire world is terminating its fictional existence.But what is really happening—since our subject is reality—is the return of the repressed God-consciousness (or if you prefer, our Buddha Nature). It had to be repressed so that the ego could feel real for a little while, until its merit had become exhausted by the serial commission of bad karma. Having sold its ability to reason for a mess of jouissance, it is now in the clutches of the lower death drive, previously known as the devil. At the same time, the devil’s polar opposite, as well as its Dreamer, in fact, the devil is the Dreamer’s own Shadow, so now the Dreamer must return in the flesh as well—and is in fact returning to more and more individual shafts of luminous consciousness, who thus become liberated from the dream, awakened into joyous laughter and the empty fullness of perfect awe and wonder.That is the wedding of Truth and Beauty, otherwise known as Shiva and Shakti, and by many other sets of names. Yet the Real is Nameless. The Real is formless. The Real is timeless. And the Real is now redeeming all that is unreal, all the remnants of this sacred Creation, this masterpiece of drama, this divine romance, this impossible Mystery, this ultimate comedy of egos, and this spectacle of special effects—is now the play is about to climax, to consummate, to culminate, to self-annihilate, to explode in blissful light.The good news is: Nothing ever really happens, at all.Om Shanti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/The-Unreality-of-the-World.png	\N	2025-07-26 13:56:48	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.317221	2025-10-28 15:31:24.317221	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But for the Sat Yogi, meditation implies a great deal more than that.	text	free	0	\N	\N	Ecstasy and The EschatonWritten in 2011.Language immanentizes the Eschaton. The hyperdimensionality of the Supreme Real is lost in the flattened intellectualized reflection that discourse forces upon our supramental intuition. To say that the Eschaton is upon us is to recognize that the Real Itself is morphing into the monstrous, invading our imaginaries, seizing up our symbolic defenses, and finally forcing us to face the beyond of language. We are entering that beyond, one way or another: through horror that is unspeakable, sadness that cannot control its tears, or infinite ecstasy that unfolds as the Eschaton embodied as the ultimate paradox that is the Self.Many people still want to waste time arguing—over how serious a crisis is this really; or whether any leader can be trusted to guide us through the transition; or whether the vaunted goal of transcendence of the ego is even more than a mirage; or if renunciation of egoic jouissance is useful, healthy, and a necessary part of a redemptive path; or whether grace will simply descend upon us all one day, no matter if we are meditating and fasting, or drinking beer and watching tv.Thankfully, there is no more time for such barren debates. Civilization is breaking apart; unpredictable catastrophes are occurring daily in every part of the world; the ecological die-off accelerates, murdering our oceans and our lands; the climate continues to morph our sacred planet savagely into a world that is uninhabitable, while armies and bands of guerrillas everywhere continue an irrelevant armed struggle, either to defend or to overthrow a system that is doomed no matter which side wins.There is no winning any more. There is no narrative that can grasp the enormity of this situation that is self-created as a karmic backlash to our existential malfeasance as a species. How can we explain the worthlessness of our lives to our children? How can we face them and admit that we do not leave them a future, that we have destroyed our home? There are no words deep enough to express the shameful feelings—were our hearts open enough even to have such feelings as we deserve to suffer.In a more creative time, operas would be performed about this Event. But there is no Wagner now to present this Egötterdämmerung of the Real, to compose a sonic tragedy about the decomposition of our world in the utter madness of petty bureaucratic sanity. New Guantanamos are being built to house the growing legions of our voiceless prophets of doom, while the media drone on about the drone wars, and drone-like we daily lose more of what is left of our souls. The Eschaton will not be televised, although we are already seeing reruns of its prequels.Yet the true Eschaton is not the mere end of a world, but the transcendence of the ultimate illusion, the Mahamaya. Apocalypse means uncovering, and what is being uncovered is the omnipotent Real that relativizes all our versions of reality, our phenomenal plane of petty concerns. It is a revelation that radically fuses life with death and time with eternity. The ego itself dissolves in the impotence of language to control or even grasp the meaning of this immeasurable Event.All our projects aimed at the approval of some Other are rendered laughable, even those intended for an extraterrestrial Other or a divine Other, let alone a human Other. The ego can do no one any favors, except by dying. There is no possible justification by works any more, except to provide a space in which egos can come to die in peace, to offer a requiem for souls in torment. All we are capable of understanding is that there is no way to understand all this, and the only payment acceptable is the renunciation of the ego. Silence is the final refuge.Acceptance can result—not of future death, of the ending of a world, but acceptance of the unbearable truth that nothing ever was: only a dream in the vast emptiness of cosmic mind.How many universes have there been before ours, utterly unremembered? How many planets have gone through a similar Eschaton as ours now faces? How many times has our own planet reached this point? How many lost civilizations still lie buried under layers of earth and fathoms of water? How much will we never know of this reality? Is not all history just a grand lie? Do we even know anything at all? Not even our own history as individuals is anything but a private myth. Yet all these narratives have somehow conspired at achieving the grandest climax of all, forcing the ultimate unmasking at this midnight of the world, the unmasking of the emptiness at the heart of all that is.Yet who is here behind all your own most tenderly cruel masks—what last edge of subjectivity is there to witness this final denouement? What holy or unholy ghost really runs the soft machine? Are you ready to discover That?Past all imaginings of light and love, past all mythologies of heaven and hell, past all dreams both collective and personal that we have futilely plastered over the black hole of the fast-approaching singularity, past all hope of some deus ex machina saving us from our fate, past even the peace of pain-free reflection on our destined demise, can we, at this last moment in which there is still margin of separation from the failed death of mere unconsciousness, resign our attention to the Absolute, and attain the Liberation that some unknowable nucleus that is beyond Being, yet within us, still pulses valiantly to realize?This supreme ecstasy that beats ever more intensely in the Heart, the ecstasy of freedom, freedom from knowing, from becoming, from yearning—this Ecstasy the ancient Shaivite sages called Anuttara, the total surrender to the ultimate and unsurpassable delight, the nameless, formless deliverance from even the cosmic mind, deliverance from the creation and from the nothingness before creation—this is the secret of the Eschaton.The true Ecstasy that no experience can reveal, that no entheogen can illumine, no eucharist can invoke, the Beyond that I forever am, is itself the Eschaton. Now Here This.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/11/Ecstasy-and-the-Eschaton.png	\N	2024-11-18 01:59:53	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.320119	2025-10-28 15:31:24.320119	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
39f695de-da7f-40cd-a299-17fb366a3538	deceptocene	Welcome to the Deceptocene!	It is now widely recognized in the fields of medicine and psychology that meditation is a powerful instrument for the management of stress, the strengthening of the immune system, and for the acceleration of healing processes in the body. Many clinical studies have validated the effectiveness of meditation not only for physical healing and the diminution of anxiety, but for the improvement of the quality of life. The sense of happiness and inner contentment has been correlated to the capacity to meditate and sustain states of serenity and stillness. But for the Sat Yogi, meditation implies a great deal more than that.	text	free	0	\N	\N	Welcome to the Deceptocene!For some time, critical theorists have declared that we have entered a new evolutionary period, that they refer to as the Anthropocene era, meaning that our biological fate is now dominated and determined by the human species, which has gained the capability not only to despoil our natural environment and bring about massive poisoning effects due to noxious geo-engineering, atmospheric pollution, genetic modification, and pharmaceutical genocide, but to cause the extinction of all life on our planet (assuming we are even on a planet).However, this theory is now passé, overtaken by newer technological developments that have been made public. The instrument that has brought us into this latest era of our seemingly aberrant historical journey is the invention of what is generally referred to as artificial intelligence (AI). The effects of this digital development began with robots and chatbots, not to mention sexbots, that can seem realistically human and actually deceive people as to their status. But now, the unfoldment has gone much further, with the advanced capacity for producing deep fake videos. Once upon a time, people believed that photos don’t lie. But now, photographs and videos can no longer be trusted to be authentic representations of real people. Not even AI can detect for certain whether a video is made by AI. Therefore, no apparent evidence of an event not personally witnessed can be trusted. We may be constantly deceived by deliberately manipulated delusions. Therefore, I am ‘christening’ our new era as the Deceptocene.This technological development has exponentially increased the ability of the agencies that control the mass media to censor alternative interpretations of reality and to produce convincing displays of seemingly conclusive and settled facts that in fact are false.Recent examples of such malicious tendencies that have been uncovered—or at least apparently so—range from the strange case of the disappeared princess Kate Middleton, around whom extreme conspiracy theories abound, due to the revelation of manipulated photographs, mislabeled photos and videos of bad look-alikes claimed to be of her but depicting another person, and the latest video of her sitting on a park bench that a number of credible experts in the field have declared to be a deep fake, with many aspects of the video that seem to prove that. Nonetheless, other seemingly objective analysts say they cannot be sure, but that they lean to thinking the video is authentic. Of course, the scandal that this has aroused has damaged the entire royal family, but Kate has not made any appearance in front of a sufficient number of living witnesses to put the embarrassment to rest.Even more recently, an apparently fake attack by Israel upon Iran has taken place. It seems that Israel had to save face after being hit by ballistic missiles from Iran, which was a retaliation for Israel’s bombing of the Iranian embassy in Syria. Since Israel did not want to suffer yet another, more destructive counter-attack by Iran, they chose to fly only a few harmless drones over Iranian territory, but then to use faked photographs of missile strikes, combined with news reports on all the mainstream US news channels announcing a massive strike on Iranian military and nuclear facilities. According to Iran, nothing like that happened, no damage occurred, no missiles were even launched toward them, and therefore, there was no reason to strike back.In such a case, it could be argued that the fake news prevented a catastrophe, and therefore was justified. But the effect on people’s trust in the news media was collateral damage that may be even more harmful—although, again, it could be asserted that it is long overdue that people stop trusting the news.So, the Deceptocene is in full flower. Once we add to the deep fake infamy a few other emergent theories, we can see that this goes much deeper than simply an artifact of AI. One example is the work of Mauro Biglino, a renowned translator of the Bible, who has demonstrated that all the translations of that text are faulty, and that the scroll is not about God at all, but is a description of an ancient alien invasion of Earth. That would be too mind-boggling to be believed, except for a plethora of other evidence both ancient and modern confirming the reality of extraterrestrial flying vehicles, crashes, interference with human military activity, abductions, animal mutilations, reverse engineering of super high-tech craft, materials, and equipment, and infiltration of governments.We could add to the list of anomalous phenomena the seeming glitches in the matrix that witnesses attest, the often persuasive evidence of the reality of the Mandela Effect, and the apparent revelation of the fraudulence of much of our accepted history, according to the highly sophisticated theory of Anatoly Fomenko, as well as other ‘phantom time’ theorists. To top it off, many leading physicists now accept that not only is matter an illusion produced by quantum wave functions that become collapsed, or frozen, by acts of consciousness, but that neither time nor space is fundamentally real. Some scientists go even further, declaring that the entire cosmos is a simulation.Of course, none of the above is certain. Probably an equal number of self-claimed authorities would debunk them all. Welcome to the Deceptocene! The Beatles long ago sang the anthem of the age: “Nothing is real! Strawberry fields forever!” But don’t eat the strawberries—they are covered with pesticides, if they are not entirely made of plastic.The question that arises in curious minds is: Why is all this happening now? What is the significance, if any? As might be expected, Sat Yogis have a simple answer. Let us begin with the understanding that the earliest ontological theory, which has been accepted in written texts from the beginning of recorded history (to use a now debunked concept) including the Vedas and carried forward in the Upanishads and is implied in the oldest agamas and yogic sutras: the theory that the world is nothing but Maya, meaning illusion. Indian philosophy, including the Buddhisms that spread throughout Asia, declare that the world lacks essential reality. It is, as the current crop of physicists now echo, only a simulation. Reality is empty of reality. Thus, we have come full circle. At the end of time, the concept that history began with is finally confirmed with overwhelming evidence that cannot be denied. Even if all the evidence is false, that too confirms the Maya theory. The very concept of evidence is evidently falsified. Once all of our beliefs unravel in this way, we start to lose trust in our capacity for reason itself. Even our logic has no foundation if this is a simulation, or a dream in some unknowable infinite Mind.But what if there is still one true element that cannot be denied? That is awareness itself. Even if our thinking is delusional, can pure awareness be doubted? Even to doubt it confirms it. Presence is ineffable, but is the very foundation of the capacity to doubt. We cannot know anything—except that presence, awareness, simple nonconceptual consciousness, somehow abides. According to the ancient yogic theory of Maya, nothing is real but quality-less absolute impersonal unmanifest presence, presence that can only be conceived as absence. At the end of time, we must return to the beginning, and to know that time never began at all—there is only timeless presence. But this presence has the creative intelligence to deceive itself into imagining itself as myriad forms of becoming in wild worlds of its own superconscious imagining, to get lost in amazing adventures in hells and heavens that no human novelist or dramatist could have conjured, even with the help of the highest doses of the most powerful psychedelic substances.But the yogis go even further: This Infinite Intelligence that is dreaming us all is not, in fact, unknowable. Simply by disengaging from the obscuring mental chatter of the character one is identified with, and coming back to silent presence, opens the portal to re-absorption in the Absolute Self. And this is the entire point of the whole creation—to awaken, to realize the eternal ultimate Self while still present in the dream field and able to act through one’s icon in the matrix. This alone has always been the goal of yoga. And the attainment of the goal brings an Aloneness that no ego still in ignorance of the Real can bear. The intensity of the Bliss of the God-Self is too much for anyone but God.And That is what You are.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/Essay-Deceptocene.jpg	\N	2024-04-19 05:04:34	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.322101	2025-10-28 15:31:24.322101	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Drawing on the Sat Yoga Chakra Map, he explains how the first three assemblage points entangle us in security needs, desire, and power struggles—and how the ego’s confusion of love with desire keeps us bound in suffering.	videoandaudio	free	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/09/2-Fri-Sep-12_Members-Teaching250819_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	4641	2025-09-12 12:35:19	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.953206	2025-11-04 11:12:52.624581	["683b32d376b5034b4455a5a1d55dc96e"]	["5xbeg-1948584-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

He explains how the energy of our fundamental nature is converted into information that appears as a holographic continuum of experience.

One can think of such examples as the twelve months of the year and the twelve houses of the zodiac, the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve labors of Hercules. This number is occurring now in such an intensified form (on 12/12/12) because it is the time of completion on three different levels: the planetary level, the individual egoic level, and the spiritual level, the latter meaning the relationship of the soul to God.	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:51:55	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.835527	2025-10-28 15:31:23.835527	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But we are only in that state if we are in the Real Self. And the problem for human consciousness is that a false self has intervened to disconnect our consciousness from the Real Self. And so we must learn to recognize the Real Self. And it’s easy to do because the Real Self differs from the false self in one essential way; the Real Self is non-arising. Any self that arises as an object, as a sense of being a body in the world, as having emotions, intentions, agendas, and relations in duality with others, is the false self. The Real Self is non-arising, and from the perspective from the false self, then, the Real Self does not exist because it doesn’t arise, it’s unborn, it’s unmanifest. But what the Real Self knows is that it’s that which arises that does not really exist; it’s not real because it’s fleeting, it’s impermanent, it’s in constant change, and it’s constantly fragmented, different emotions, different attitudes, different thoughts, contradictory, conflicting, feeling, and cognition states; whereas the Real Self that’s non-arising is eternal, unchanging, immutable — untouched by the chaos of the false self.”	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:43:43	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.83776	2025-10-28 15:31:23.83776	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The body is the wax, the mind is the wick, but until the wick is lit by the Flame of Shiva, the candle cannot do its service, and our service is to remain always lit up by that Flame. Never let that light go out. That light will itself dissolve the ego and its sufferings, and its narcissism and its lack of understanding of the Real, and the flame itself will do the work, the flame itself will inspire the thoughts in the mind that will come as gifts to oneself and the world, the flame itself will give the power for the physical labor, the flame itself will create the love and the unity. So trust in Shiva, keep the Flame lit, don’t make it something theoretical, but always be in the state of Karma Yoga.	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:40:50	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.839487	2025-10-28 15:31:23.839487	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is a fact that Seva Saves, but we have to know what we mean by Seva and we have to know what we mean by being saved. Because Seva is not simply work, it’s not about being a workaholic, that is not service and in fact those who have workaholic tendencies, their service is to do nothing. There has to be a balance, because often if you are a workaholic means you are running away from yourself. Rather than serving God, you are running away from God… under the guise of serving God, and it’s important that we don’t do that. The action must be balanced with the meditation. (Event: Seva Saves!

The ego is a state of hypnosis, a self-reinforcing hypnosis through the suggestions that the ego is constantly filling your mind with. That is why we say, at the end of every meditation, the words Aum, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti. The word Shanti means both peace and silence and it is said three times because the triple silence is necessary to shift the energy field. The triple silence… of outer silence, no intention of speaking to an other, the silence of the mind, in which there is no inner speaking between fragments of the ego or superego, and the Ultimate Supreme Silence of the Presence of the Supreme Self. It is when all those three levels are in alignment that the energy field shifts.	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:35:52	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.845133	2025-10-28 15:31:23.845133	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is language that created the split between the illusion of an inside world and an outside world. There is no such thing, there is only one world. There really is no experience and imperience, it only seems that way because language makes it so, and we buy into the illusion of thoughts as if they were real, when they are utterly unreal. It is language that has split the Self from God, has split humanity from Nature, has split each of us from each other, has created all the conflict and the wars and competitions, and the desire to create bigger and bigger weapons to defend this imaginary being against that imaginary being, and in the process devastating what is real.

But it must remain absent, because it is the secret yoga. It is the yoga of Love. And bhakti yoga must never become a separate yoga, because it is non-separation. As soon as it becomes some separate specialized form, it becomes reduced to rituals and ceremonies and mantras and chanting and holding hands and hugging and that sort of thing, and the real meaning of the yoga of Love is lost. The yoga of Love is the true esoteric yoga, the most esoteric of all. Without the yoga of Love, there is no raja yoga, it is an empty, futile, boring exercise in concentration, it is praja yoga, not raja yoga. Raja is the king, praja is the subject. We don’t want to do the yoga of subjects, begging for crumbs from the king. This is a kingdom of Love.

Love is all you need in this song, but it must be real Love and it must be Love for God. No other Love will liberate you. In fact, the other kinds of love will enslave you and devastate you. But do we love God? For most people the idea of God is too abstract to love. Not for those who inquire very deeply and recognize that God is within, but even for many of those the power of God is too great.

7b79bb39-0731-424b-9edf-c15dcda2ba06	beyond-identifications	Beyond Identifications	Silence doesn’t really have a charge, in fact it is the absence of all charge. It begins usually with serenity, and that deepens into a very deep sense of peace and well-being; then, happiness emerges from that and blossoms into joy. The heart opens to that joy and then the flow of Divine Love emerges until there is the overflow into bliss. So we have to sit long enough to allow the full experience, full realization and stabilize in it, and not have even the trace of an “I-thought” thinking this is happening to me, but complete silence, so that you are it. If there is still an “I-thought” that is containing it, or judging it, or evaluating it, it will hold down the experience to a shallow level. So there has to be a complete surrender and melting into it, and then there indeed is a charge, very powerful.

aaf6d14a-16d8-4cc0-a5e1-675e6a412eaf	the-four-pillars-of-yoga	The Four Pillars of Yoga	“The traditional yogic texts say that a yogic life is built on four pillars, and attending Satsang is one of those. The other three are: simplicity, leading a simple life without excess, without ostentation, without wastage. . . . truthfulness, a yogi is dedicated to being truthful—and more than just truthful in a factual sense, but leading an authentic life. . . . the third one is seva, or service, to lead a life that’s not based on getting as much as you can for yourself, but of giving as much as you can to the world. . . . Now, a Satsang, for those of you who haven’t been to one, the word “Sat” you’ll notice appears a lot in our discourse here, Sat refers to the Supreme Beingness, the truth of what we are when we take away all of the falseness and the mediated and artificial aspects of our self, when we get down to what is natural and eternal in ourselves. And yoga means “yoke,” union. . . . You know we tend to think that that it’s only people out there who sabotage our happiness, but it’s actually we who are responsible for that; we set that up. And once we assume our own responsibility for our happiness, then life begins to get a lot better. . . . And gradually our intellect, our buddhi, becomes clearer and clearer, and we begin to realize the ways that we’d been sabotaging ourselves on subtler and subtler levels until we get to the root of the phantasies that have been motivating us to deny ourselves or to cheat ourselves of our own bliss . . .”	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:30:26	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.850744	2025-10-28 15:31:23.850744	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

You can think of them as holding up the inner temple. The two outer pillars are gyana and dharma. Gyana is understood as having two levels, the lower gyana and the higher gyana. In this case, the outer pillar is the lower gyana, which is the conceptual understanding of non-duality, of your absolute oneness with God; that yourself is the One Self. That absolute understanding of that and the capacity to affirm that in your mind when maya begins to attack is the first protection.	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:29:07	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.851621	2025-10-28 15:31:23.851621	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
8223f6f7-de17-45cc-93d6-2967f7d70d2a	on-the-brink-of-reality	On the Brink of Reality	“In Christianity there is a trinity as we all know: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This trinity is an archetype and exists in every religion, every spiritual path, although it has different names in different paths. . . . In the yogic path, it’s only one of a number of trinities, however; we could call it the “vertical trinity.” And the equivalent in the yogic tradition is noted by the words “Sat, Chit, and Ananda.”  . . . But there is also a horizontal trinity that is often noted by the names of three gods:” Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankara.” . . . They refer to creation, sustenance, and destruction, if you will—or transformation. But you can think of it as kind of a black board, or a white board, which is the Absolute; we could say that’s Shiva. And then on that someone writes with a pen a sentence that is a narrative, an ego narrative: the story of a civilization, the story of a culture—or the story of your own life. And then once that’s written, Vishnu repeats it over and over again; it becomes a pattern that gets sustained in one’s life. Not only sustained, but if the pattern is pathological, then stained: one’s life becomes stained by a pattern that repeats automatically, over and over again. How many of you have had the experience of making the same mistake over and over again in your life?”	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:23:19	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.852564	2025-10-28 15:31:23.852564	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

In the Ramayana, it is Rama, God the Father, and Sita, who is the soul/the Holy Spirit, who goes into exile at some point, captured by the demonic forces. And then you have the Son, Hanuman, who is a monkey god. Very odd, why would they choose a monkey god to represent the Son? And it’s because the human being in the state of ego-consciousness is a monkey: its monkey mind is always chattering, its interests are mainly in food and sex, and it is wild and will not come under discipline. So the monkey is a wonderful metaphor. And yet this monkey, Hanuman, becomes divine. . . . It is said that God stands for G.O.D.: Generation, Operation, Destruction. . . . And we are now at a point where our current world cannot be sustained any longer because of the lack of love.”	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:17:12	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.853762	2025-10-28 15:31:23.853762	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Karma yoga is the essence of love in action, “to act without greed, possessiveness, the desire for some ulterior agenda to be fulfilled by the ego, then that will be able to unravel the egos knots and unwillingness to love. The second one is community because its not just a matter of ‘What do I do,’ but the real test is can I help form a communion of love with other human beings?cause that’s the ultimate test isn’t it?

The reading of chapter two of the Ashtavakra Samhita is the basis of this teaching on the joy of Self-Realization. Sustained joy is not possible for the ego, since it projects its own shadow on the world and suffers as a result. But, when it is understood that one is Pure Consciousness—that all is the One Infinite Intelligence and that the world is only a reflection of the Self at play—then divine beauty is directly perceived, unconditional love is felt, and perfection is recognized.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/2Fri-Jul-25-Members-Teaching-250625_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	4158	2025-07-25 12:30:50	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.96167	2025-11-04 11:15:24.378795	["81dec6b223e12373d698a68c032c8e4e"]	["5cidi-1907055-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

We mistake this simulation for a real world; thus, the Real, or God, has become an empty signifier even for those who claim to be religious. The current ego structure is programmed to love sensory enjoyments, but to avoid and cover over with noise and pictures the silence and stillness of the inmost Self. Silence has come to signify death, which has been desperately repressed, so the Death Drive returns as global war.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/3Fri-Jul-18_Members-Teaching-250705_Hopeless-Hilarious_Midday-GM-Teaching-QA.png	4068	2025-07-18 12:21:00	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.962787	2025-11-04 11:15:25.51113	["2cd633103ba1f34b42ce25b76d2d66ba"]	["nhrgz-18fdc8e-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

In this electrifying teaching, Shunyamurti returns us to the original foundation of all true yogic paths: the complete and instantaneous renunciation of the ego through the love of the infinite Self. This is not a path of gradualism or compromise. It is a radical return to the Real, beyond all illusion, trauma, fear, or thought. True liberation comes not with time, but with unwavering determination, tapas, and surrender. This is the final frontier—the rite of passage into God-consciousness. And the gate is gateless, because you are already That.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/2-Fri-Jun-26-MEMBERS-250514_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	3584	2025-07-11 11:57:34	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.96377	2025-11-04 11:15:26.621383	["a77d4223edf0e5164b36cba759fa1497"]	["if7ti-18f21cc-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But it requires a lot of preparation. One needs uncommon sense to reason through the barrier of the unreal, and a willingness to dialectically negate one’s own desire for the Real when that becomes the new barrier. Then, even that negation must be negated by the immolation of the last trace of a tendency of the mind to produce an egocentric thought.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/2-Fri-Jun-13-Members-Teaching-250604_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA-1.jpg	4077	2025-06-27 12:23:21	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.965939	2025-11-04 11:15:29.004872	["746f6a2e0db9da6902868607365a9ded"]	["8egpy-18cfb23-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This goal requires ceaseless effort; mindfulness; Self-enquiry; refinement of thought, speech and action; sublimation of impulses and cessation of old sanskaras.The yogic life is one of purity of mind and heart, nobility and generosity of spirit, egoless action, and disciplined patterns of relationship, in order to remain untouched by maya, the illusion of body-identification that produces all forms of suffering.The yogi must be both a gyani and a bhakta—a Self-reflective cognitive atmanologist and metaphysicist and simultaneously a devotee mad with the ecstasy of divine love.By flying with the aid of these two wings, one stabilizes one’s flight to the celestial realms of Light, until the soul dissolves entirely into the Absolute.On the phenomenal plane, life is lived in the paradoxical unity of duality and nonduality. This is what the Vaishnav saints mean by being a gopi—literally, a cowgirl, a dedicated keeper of the sacred cow, symbol of the divine giver of the milk of human kindness and the primal sound of om. There are, of course, both gopes and gopis, cowherds in male and female forms, who milk the Goddess of Love and share the cream of Her creation, the nectar of sweetest grace and joy.The gope or gopi is most of all an enraptured lover of Krishna, an incarnation of God; the gopi is a lover who is also part of the same beloved avataric nonduality-within-duality. This is expressed by the subtle concept of achintya bhedabheda. This means that opposite realities are nested within one another: nonduality within duality, and vice versa; samsara within nirvana, and vice versa; time within eternity, and vice versa; and on and on, with every metaphysical set of binaries.The gopi sees the Supreme everywhere, as the intelligent life force pervading every being, every appearance, every moment, including the consciousness that is the perceiver thereof. The passion for the formless One shining through the myriad forms seemingly objectively separate, yet all pointing to the Supreme Self that emanates and animates this play of self-luminous consciousness, sustains the gopi/yogi in her joyous constancy of pure sublime Presence.But occasionally, maya may break through and disturb even an adept gopi’s peace of mind. In fact, maya is nested within lila, and lila within maya. There is recognition of all this as the perfect play of divine goodness. But this perception may oscillate with egoic frustration at the resistances of the Real to achieving the harmony of heavenly flow. The density of the tamasic world seemingly defies the will of heaven.The ego wants to surrender its lower impulses, and to see the divine, the shining subtle Light, in everyone. But at times it may see only a narcissistic ego, or only a threat to one’s own narcissistic equilibrium. At times, the gopi may want to go pee on the Other, feeling envy for the imagined superiority of another’s beauty or goodness or strength or intelligence. Or lustful desire may raise its ugly head. Or there may be momentary hatred of someone who has rebuffed one’s advances or offers of friendship.All this is enough to give any self-respecting gopi a case of the blues. Sometimes, one may have to sing the blues literally. At other times, one may have to write sad poetry or keep a diary of such egoic excreta, in order not to contaminate one’s interpersonal relationships. But slogging through the mud of maya is an inherent part of the great journey to ego transcendence.From the infantile bawling and sulking of the blues, a gopi who is intent on growing through the pain of loss and acceptance of impermanence forms the blue note into jazz; a gopi who is intent on transforming the ego into a soulful structure of integrity, strength, maturity, empowerment, and vision, will use the pain of abandonment and loneliness, the anxiety of separation, the terror of life lived alone in a world suddenly shredded into an abyss of despair, to riff a musical sculpture of ascending octaves of supreme desire for Liberation; from being bereft in a space without reference points, falling through nothingness, groundless, meaningless, pointlessly alive…the gopi gathers the strength of faith to go through ego death. The music of the spheres is heard on the akashic airwaves.The long, dark night of the soul cannot be evaded. But now the angels sing in the moonlight of the night sea journey. And while the gopi listens to the primeval om sound coming from amidst the sacred cows, heard even in the darkness, a heavenly trumpet sounds in resonance; she sees the gold-blue glow of Krishna in the distance, along with primal percussions of tambourines and drums; she attunes to the sweet love song of Radha, Her voice voluptuous with absolute surrender; and then the whirling, rhythmic dance of ultimate divine devotion, opens the portal to the dimension beyond, so close, so far, so yearned for.Here the coming home gets supremely real, the whole of time is but a vanished dream, as the kirtan calls, the yearning of the heart responds, and Krishna is revealed—as I. The heart pulls presence deeper inward now, it recognizes all phenomena as mere projections of the Self, guideposts on the path to silence. And the goal is reached. All illusion falls away into the stillness, the music absolute, sat chit ananda…the last swaha!Yes, even gopis get the blues. But the blues never get the gopis. They are always riding the crest of the rising wave, detached from both suffering and joy, knowing the passionate union of Radha-Krishna is the only Real, that bliss eternal is our home, no matter what we may be feeling in a momentary passage through a wisp of maya fog.When gopis get the blues, they turn it into music that shakes the foundations of the ego’s world. They may hit bottom, but only to spring back up, all the way to the highest realm of Anuttara. When gopis get the blues, their song of desire for reunion with the One opens even the heart of Shiva, Who carries them to the holy mountain, Arunachala. Shiva takes the poison of their suffering away, and swallows it. So even Shiva gets the blues, at least in His throat. That is God’s service, when He works through a form.Though even gopis get the blues, as we approach the deep blue sea of Love and the infinite blue sky of Mind, beyond the reach of maya’s pull, only the serenity and coolness of the royal blue of the true third eye remains. The Self dissolves all pain. Sat Yuga will dawn once more, and even Krishna’s tone seems brighter now—now that the gopis blew away their blues.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming Obstacles	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 09:29:34	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.375087	2025-10-28 15:31:24.375087	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Once one takes responsibility for one’s karma, the portal to freedom opens. Dropping the ego narrative is easy as soon as you recognize that the body (and its operating system) is not you. What you are is consciousness without name, form, attitudes, or thoughts. You are the luminous intelligence of the Absolute Self. When That is realized, suffering ends.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/3-Fri-May-24Members-Teaching240508_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	3162	2024-05-24 12:29:17	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.999004	2025-11-04 11:16:20.841311	["ee966f2a22cc16163226ce519c78356e"]	["nsaak-1610bd7-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But the ego mind has turned away from the Source and is lost in the darkness of delusion. This is the moment that the Supreme Self has chosen to return, bringing all souls back to the eternal stillness and peace of the Infinite Merciful Heart of the Real. For the ego, this will seem like world destruction, while for the illumined souls, this is the moment of redemption. The end is also the new beginning. The Kingdom of Heaven awaits those who surrender all to the Lord in humble adoration. Make use of this window of greatest opportunity while it is open. In this teaching, the seven secret teachings of Shiva are explained in depth.

It desperately needs to create a defined personality with fixed views and prejudice against other paradigms of reality, since otherwise it cannot hold on to the feeling that it exists. The ego’s lack of existence thus is repressed and over that black hole is projected the image of a self-fashioned fictional entity that believes it is real. The entity likewise constructs an unreal world on which it projects its many dissociated fragments with their desires, plus its shadow drives, foreclosed wisdom, and objects of both desire and fear. To awaken from this self-created hell realm, the consciousness must release its clinging to conceptualizations, including that of the imagined ego.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/4Fri-Apr-5Members-Teaching231105_Morning-GM-Teaching-1.png	1578	2024-04-05 12:12:40	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.025605	2025-11-04 11:17:01.178991	["1adb67348a0a77fba2286c6ca747d1a6"]	["6hq6d-15d02f8-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

According to quantum theory, subatomic particles can be in a condition of superposition—in other words, the particle can be in two states at once, until observed. Thus, the killing mechanism in the box could be both triggered and not triggered. So, Schrödinger wondered: Could the cat be both alive and dead at the same time?	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	In 1935, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger proposed a thought experiment in which a live cat was placed in a sealed box together with a mechanism that could be triggered by a quantum event—the decay of a subatomic particle that had a certain probability of happening—that would kill the cat when it occurred. According to quantum theory, subatomic particles can be in a condition of superposition—in other words, the particle can be in two states at once, until observed. Thus, the killing mechanism in the box could be both triggered and not triggered. So, Schrödinger wondered: Could the cat be both alive and dead at the same time?For some thinkers, including Einstein, this was obviously impossible, a reductio ad absurdum. But for others, it was clear that quantum physics points to just this possibility. To explain such theoretical high strangeness, many theories have since emerged, including the possibility of parallel universes.But Schrödinger’s cat has today emerged from its box, and is dead-and-alive and well and smiling uncannily at us, like another cat from Cheshire, from every point of our macro-reality. We are clearly now passing through an extraordinary moment of the revelation of quantum superposition in our phenomenal plane.Let’s take a look at some of the nine lives of Schrödinger’s elusively undead feline. In the political realm, it is perhaps most obvious. For example, did Egypt just celebrate a successful popular revolution or has freedom been curtailed by a military coup? It is clear that both are true. Egypt is in a state of political superposition. In fact, this is true of many states today, and the number of such superposed countries is multiplying rapidly. Indeed, if we look closely enough, we can see that it is true of all—nations today are both functioning and failed states at the same time. The U.S. is the best example—it is both the richest and the most impoverished. If you don’t believe it, check out the size of its national debt.In sociological terms, the same superposition is visible. People are in upward mobility and simultaneously in downward mobility. They are happy and miserable. Their lives are both full and empty. Some would prefer to call it denial, but it is a genuine superposition.In a more paranormal level of life, we can examine the experiences of thousands, if not millions, of people who say they have been abducted by aliens. Their experiences certainly seem real to them. Yet the objective evidence is slim to none. Alternative mundane explanations can account for these stories, and the case histories show every indication of fitting snugly into the profile of hysteria, as developed in Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, or archetypal visions, if you ask a Jungian. On the other hand, there is indeed a tremendous amount of objective evidence that extraterrestrials are visiting our planet. Did non-earthly beings really kidnap these people—or do they suffer from hysterical delusions? Or archetypal downloads from the collective unconscious? What if all the above are true? This is an important example of superposition that is directly affecting the consciousness of large numbers of human beings. In many cases, the superposition has shifted into an even more radical octave: there are a growing number of apparently sane people who feel that they themselves are both human and alien.Quantum undecidability also reigns in most people’s minds about whether we are headed for planetary apocalypse or the dawn of a golden age. Some see that it is obvious that modern life is unsustainable ecologically, and can list all the plagues that are coming at us right now, which require not just four horsemen, but a stampeding army of wraith-riders bringing death and destruction as karmic blowback to our morally degraded world. But others are living in glorious optimism, in a sunny world of high technology that will soon solve all our planet’s problems, and even lead to a singularity in which human intellect merges with far more powerful artificial intelligence in a cyborg utopia of limitless longevity for titanium-based life forms sharing a virtual matrix of unified consciousness. Still others find the cyborg future a horrid dystopian vision, and instead share a different sort of optimism, seeing a future of transcendent beings in light bodies, re-dreaming the world through mystic psycho-technology, in a unified field of divine love. Can all these visions be simultaneously true? Quantum theory says yes (and simultaneously of course, no).If indeed what we are witnessing is quantum superposition writ large, then many people will be experiencing this as terrifying fragmentation. It is producing anxiety and even psychosis in some, and at the same time, ecstatic mystical awakening in others. In fact, some people are in superposed states of enlightenment and psychic meltdown in the same instant. There was a time when we needed to take LSD, magic mushrooms, or ayahuasca to experience such feelings and throw open the doors of multidimensional perception. But now, it is happening unbidden to more and more of us.A comedienne some years ago delivered a wonderful line: Reality is a crutch for people who can’t handle drugs. But things have now changed. The crutch is being removed. Reality itself is a drug that is wearing off. None of our stories hold together any more. The opposites are crashing into one another. Time is yielding to simultaneity. Sense and nonsense interpenetrate.Of course, religion has always affirmed quantum superposition. What is Christ except the symbol of the superposition of man and God? The Buddhists say that samsara is in superposition with nirvana. Form is superposed with emptiness. The Advaitins assert that that the world of multiplicity is superposed with the Absolute. Duality is nonduality. The ego mind is in superposition with the mind of God, body-consciousness with the Buddha-nature.Schrödinger’s monstrous cat has been loosed upon our world. We had better prepare ourselves for its approach. It is marking its territory everywhere. It is rubbing against our legs. We are already in quantum entanglement with its tail. Soon it will jump into our lap. Already we can’t tell if we are coming or going, if we are at alpha or omega. You look into the mirror and see the back of your head. You look in someone’s eyes and realize you are gazing at yourself. You look out the window and see a déjà view. “You know something’s happening here, but you don’t know what it is.” The cat has disappeared yet somehow it isbeginning to speak through your mouth. You are becoming the cat’s meow.Some of us hope to awaken from our surrealistic pillow, while others relish playing in the inter-net of Indra. But this feline genie will not be put back into the Klein Bottle of Schrödinger’s mind. The apocalypse of linear thinking is already upon us. Normalcy is a pipe dream. Materialism is a laugh, capitalism a bad smell that is thankfully dissipating, and the whole symbolic order is written in vanishing ink. Even the continents are poised to sink beneath the waves and allow new landmasses to rise in a re-born Earth. Everything is now possible.But this magical moment in which the quantum wave is de-collapsing will not last. We are returning to the initial conditions of transfinite quantum potentiality, as the cosmic wave massively superposes new possibilities upon every undecidable superposition, burgeoning into a blur of becoming, ghostly waves of nightmarish beauty, extending outward and inward to infinity upon infinity. We are in a real Fantasia, and the sorcerer’s apprentice has muffed the mantra in a ghastly goof. And yet it is a given, opening us again to the giving-ness of God.Return, t’shuvah in the Kabbalistic tradition, enables tikkun—the repair of the world. But full repair cannot be achieved unless we surrender to the Absolute beyond all possible conditions. As Islam rightly insists, there is no god but God. We must stop our worship of the ego, our sin of making idols out of money, physical beauty, power, or other mere mirage-like manifestations of the Absolute, and return all our attention and love one-pointedly to the Source. For optimal results in this tango of entanglement, the cosmic dance of Shakti and Shiva, we must humbly pay our homage to Emptiness. We must de-cathect our demonic and catabolic desires, de-focus our fixations, and junk our juvenile jouissance. Only then can we avoid being overwhelmed by the deadly fallout of our malpractice of creative consciousness.This is the moment not only of superposition, but of super-consciousness. If we awaken to the hidden power we have been given, and use it with integrity, then this bardo state will birth a paradise; otherwise, what is to ensue will be unbearable. And the ultimate option is now also open: Supreme Liberation from this hall of mirrors, in union with the Absolute. Whatever you choose, says Schrödinger’s cat, remember it is all purr-fection.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nPhilosophyScience	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:05:12	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.40721	2025-10-28 15:31:24.40721	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The more one complains, the more ugly and antagonistic one’s world becomes. And one is then trapped on the wheel of karma. The Truth is that all is forever perfect! The kingdom of heaven arrives when one sees that.

There are, of course, certain skills involved and one little renunciation.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/5.-Fri-Mar-17-Members-Teaching-We-Are-Experiencing-a-Pole-Shift.png	978	2023-03-16 22:21:54	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.070887	2025-11-04 11:18:12.226161	["2844e4cbb8e2f4eb22d250d992e86c96"]	["i7jwq-13b340a-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

When we do that, we become buddhas. Buddhas have access to the omniscient wisdom of the Akashic dimension and its unlimited storehouse of information. We need that information now, and thus we need to realize our buddha-nature, if we are to navigate accurately through these apocalyptic times.Yoga is the original science of consciousness. It was far ahead of our current materialist pseudo-science of consciousness, the one that is looking futilely at our neurons and synapses to find the meaning and source of consciousness. Modern science is a joke when it comes to consciousness. And since everything eventually comes to consciousness, modern sciences, other than physics, are of little help to us. The scientistic mindset remains determined to deny teleology, God, and the Akashic records (or the Alaya-Vigyana in Buddhist terminology), or any other concept that would enable us to grok the fact that we are caught in a spacetime vortex that is bringing a rapid end to the world as we have known it and hurling us into a new phase and level of existence. Since the velocity of the vortex is accelerating at a mind-boggling rate, we must activate our buddhi now, while it is still possible to do so, to have an influence on the outcome of this trans-cosmic event, so that we can arrange to get spit out into a new world that is worth living in. Few of us realize the real nature of our power to influence events. This is also a result of our indoctrination into a materialist culture that is clueless regarding consciousness. So the study of the original science of consciousness, sat yoga, is essential.By the way, the term yoga has been degraded in these end times of kali yuga to refer to a form of physical exercise. None of what currently goes under the name of yoga, which focuses on asanas and pranayamas (stretching and balance poses plus breathing techniques) was part of the original yogic science. The original form of yoga focused on the development and use of our capacity of attention in order to discover the ground of Being, referred to in Sanskrit as Sat. Once consciousness merges in Sat (which is also another name for God-consciousness), many other powers, or siddhis, can be attained. These correspond to the same attributes that physicists have discovered to function at the quantum level of reality, such as interconnectivity, the capacity to be in more than one place at a time, to convert from particle to wave form, the capacity to transcend time, and to perceive the dimension of eternity that permeates time (realizing the unity of samsara and nirvana, as the later Buddhist yogis would put it), and so on.The immersion in Sat, a state known as Samadhi, is the goal of authentic yoga. This achievement of Sat-mind comes with the side-benefits of chit and ananda (divine intelligence and the bliss of infinite love). So it is worth the effort to become a Sat Yogi, since it is the key to happiness, wisdom, and ultimate redemption. By the way, all the current religions began as schools of Sat Yoga, but gradually, as these schools became politically powerful, they were infiltrated and co-opted by human egos with lower agendas, and eventually they were reduced to the condition of fossils, caricatures of their original form, and dogmatized into media of social control.After the above excursus, let us return to our main topic. To re-establish the science of consciousness for the postmodern mind, which has been reduced to a condition of attention deficit disorder and thus cannot practice Sat Yoga effectively, we can still awaken and activate the buddhi by examining two well-known phenomena that have been conclusively established as real—even though mainstream scientists largely steer clear of both, fearing punishment by the inquisitors of the scientific establishment.The first phenomenon is what has come to be called near death experiences, or NDEs. In fact, this name is inaccurate, since it occurs to people who are not just near death, but who are fully and truly dead, clinically speaking, but whose death is aborted, thanks largely to the modern resuscitation technology available in emergency rooms. So let us call these aborted death experiences, or ADEs. There are so many cases of this phenomenon reported that it cannot be denied. Moreover, it cannot be explained away as a mere hallucinatory product of lack of oxygen in the brain, or any other such materialistic neurological account, since the returnee from death is coolly able to report observations made during the first stage of the ADE. This stage is the initial out-of-body experience. The soul-bearing subtle body (sukshma sharira in Sanskrit) pops out of the gross physical organism and finds that it can move at will, free of gravity, wherever it wishes. The subtle entity often wanders around the hospital, overhears conversations going on in different rooms, discovers interesting objects, and sometimes watches with amusement all the efforts being made to resuscitate its physical vehicle. Later, after the death process has been aborted, the subjects will report on what they observed during their deaths, and this information has been found to be amazingly accurate. No merely hallucinatory brain event could produce such hard data.In the second stage of the ADE, the subjects enter a wormhole and are carried up, sometimes with the help of angels, into a higher dimension, where they encounter the Great Light. They receive from angelic guidance counselors a life review, a kind of report card on how they have been doing in the school of life so far, and a great deal of higher wisdom, as well as heart-melting supreme love, and are opened to a much more integrative vision of the meaning of it all. When they are sent back into the physical plane to continue with their lives, they are often disappointed and even traumatized at having to return to this primitive plane of lower consciousness and lack of love.The Aborted Death Experience is clearly real, more real than life itself. It proves a number of things to us, if we are willing to let its reality sink in. One is that death is not the end. We are in a long-term process of life-death-and-rebirth. The wheel of rebirth is intended as a developmental process, in which we are to refine our consciousness until we are ready to graduate from this cosmic gear-wheel and enter higher levels of Being. So there should be no fear of death. We have been there, done that, countless times. Second, it proves that our world is governed by a supreme intelligence Who is motivated by love, and that angelic presences are here with us, subtly guiding us, if we will accept this assistance. Third, it means that our current conventional values are completely out of alignment with the nature of reality, and this is the underlying reason for our current troubles in this world. We have been committing too much bad karma. We have sown the wind, and are reaping the whirlwind, as another yogic lineage puts it. Fourth, the capacities that we realize that we have at the moment of death we have now. We can learn to use them now, while we are still alive. But to do this, we must become dedicated scientists of consciousness, or Sat Yogis.The second phenomenon we must understand is that of extraterrestrial intervention on our planet. This, too, is common knowledge, and the reality of the phenomenon has been overwhelmingly proved by evidence that is scientifically solid. This includes reams of testimony by the highest level of trained observers, unambiguous photographic evidence, and even hard physical evidence. But the ruling political powers do not yet want to recognize this reality, and thus it is still ridiculed by the major media and mainstream pseudo-authorities. If you do not yet recognize this fact, please do your due diligence regarding this urgent matter. It is true that there is a lot of disinformation out there on this topic, but the generally recognized core group of credible scientific researchers of this phenomenon is in agreement as to most of the central propositions of what has come to be called ufology.By the way, that term is clearly obsolete, since we are no longer dealing only with unidentified flying objects, but with intelligent beings who are abducting and tracking people and performing various kinds of biological and psychic procedures, who are making extraordinary interventions in human military and political affairs, and who have apparently established secret underground and underwater bases on this planet, as well as on the moon and other nearby planets. (All this has been reported by astronauts who have had close encounters in outer space, and by other individuals with privileged positions in the military-industrial establishments with top secrecy clearances. It has been reported from so many people, from so many parts of the world, that the general contours of this phenomenon cannot be doubted.) Some have given this field the name exopolitics. But far more than politics is involved. And since we seek to integrate what we know of the reality of resident aliens with what we know about the reality of God and of angels, and the reality that we are in a turbulent planetary vortex leading from one world-historic era to another, it would be useful to place all of these phenomena into a single paradigm that will be referred to here as trans-cosmic relations.By the way, the precognition noted in the Mayan calendar that this would be the cusp between one cosmic time cycle and another is not so difficult to understand when we recognize that some of the same extraterrestrials that have returned in modern times were the very ones who devised the Mayan calendar in the first place. The assistance of non-Earthling technology in designing and building the megaliths of the ancient world in both hemispheres is well known, as is the extraordinary level of astronomical and geophysical knowledge that was present and later lost. The problem of how the same archetypal forms of architecture and scientific knowledge, including the knowledge of the destiny of humanity, got disseminated worldwide is solved once we recognize that the authors of those texts written in stone are the ones now fulfilling their own prophecies.Those who have achieved immersion in an interdimensional samadhi as a result of disciplined meditative practice, as well as those who have had such experiences with the aid of tryptamines, realize that the whole universe is alive. Life is not limited to vegetables, animals, and extraterrestrial life forms. The rocks are alive. The wind is alive. The whole Earth is alive. There are elementals, nature sprites, orbs, chthonic powers, daimons, wandering earthbound spirits, poltergeists, interdimensional portal keepers, prosaic entities of the unconscious, archetypal epiphanies, all the monsters from the id, and on and on. The variety of actants in this boundless multiverse is limitless. And all these diverse forces and forms compose a single whole. The realization of the ultimate nondual nature of the Real is known in Sanskrit as Advaita. Only when we learn to perceive all forms and beings from the inner space of emptiness (shunyata) in which the subject/object binary collapses into oneness, and the oneness into the zero point of the Supreme Self, can the unity of all that is be actualized and permeated by the irresistible power of infinite love. In this transformation of consciousness, the aliens will be recognized as (or transformed into) luminous angels, and this apocalyptic period clearly perceived as the birthing of the new kingdom of heaven.To bring about the most auspicious outcome of this moment—a historic moment that amounts to the trial and final judgment of our human soul nature—our complete and utter surrender of ego and attention to the presence of the God-Self within is essential to activate the majestic experience of birth into the bliss of Absolute awareness. This alone will optimize the outcome on the global planetary level for our species and for trans-cosmic relations as a whole. To achieve this shift of consciousness, we must jettison all lesser identifications. We must renounce our Earth-centric and human-centric views, let alone our even more petty and paranoid ethnocentric, nationalistic, materialistic and capitalistic ideologies.Ironically, so many people are obsessed with the pseudo-problem of “illegal aliens” entering their countries that they cannot see that they have been occupied by, and are about to be dispossessed by, far more advanced aliens than the poor fellow human immigrants they are complaining about. But beyond letting go of our egocentric prejudices, we must let go of the ego itself, and realize our essence as the pure consciousness that underlies, permeates, and manifests as the entire phenomenal reality. We must also make sure that this knowledge is not misused to create oppressive cults or other forms of mind control, but to enable liberation from all constraints on the human capacity for growth and development of consciousness toward its natural fulfillment. This is why there must be a fundamental ethical commitment to ahimsa, non-violence, and to a life of virtue, of simplicity, equality, and humility. This is how we can fully join in God’s play with the power of manifestation, the Great Lila of Shiva and Shakti.The sooner we join together in communities of true yogis, and enter into holy communion with the One Supreme Consciousness, and invite the extraterrestrial children of God into our communes to commune with us as a single family of angelic manifestations of Allah, the sooner and the easier will be our birth into the next Sat Yuga. May your angelic core nature emerge from its human husk. May your profound connection with all beings terrestrial and extraterrestrial be apperceived. May you be liberated into the Supernal Light of blissful omniscience.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nNonduality	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:01:07	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.411443	2025-10-28 15:31:24.411443	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This is the double bind on the symbolic level.The more intelligent we become in terms of being able to manipulate symbolic forms, the more alienated we become from the Real that lies beyond the realm of symbols. And so we can say that Self-realization is a matter of surrender of the power of symbolic manipulation, investigation, and articulation to the higher power of Presence.Once we enter into the realm of symbols, we have sacrificed our Presence, the mind dwells in a secondary realm that orbits around Presence, much as a satellite orbits around the earth, a realm that represents the Presence, but is not that.“The word murders the thing,” as Hegel once said. And so we enter into this plane where we think we understand everything, but in fact we truly touch nothing. We have alienated ourselves from the Essence of Being, in order to understand it, to grasp it conceptually, but the conceptual understanding has removed us from the Heart, which is the only true understanding.And so, while we do not want to lose our symbolic capacity, we need not sacrifice our Being. But only by recognizing the higher power of Presence can the lower power of symbolic mapping become transformed into an instrument of the Self.Because the ego is identified with this power of symbolic articulation (because it is both a weapon and a tool, which is very useful for egoic purposes on the phenomenal plane), the ego strives to appropriate all symbolic maps to use for its own purposes. This makes the conceptual grids useless as means of reaching our Being.But once we have centered ourselves in our Being, we can use those tools of symbolic knowledge for the purpose of transforming the ego structure itself. To accomplish this, however, we must be dis-identified from the ego. But if we are identified with that tool, if we think of ourselves as symbolic entities, then we will be possessed by the egoic logic, which is always obsessed with gaining power over others.And the very addiction to that illusory power, the phenomenal power, rather than the surrender to the real power, the noumenal power of Supreme Being, seduces us into further illusion. So the spiritual battle revolves around the courage and truthfulness required not to abuse the illusory power that symbolic manipulation gives us, while taking us away from the Heart, our true Self.And so we can measure our progress in the spiritual realm, by the degree of surrender of the discursive intellectual mind that wants to use sophisticated forms of thought for its own territorial purposes, rather than to effect surrender to the Supreme Presence that is beyond thought.Paradoxically, the more that the discursive mind surrenders to the Heart, which is the Divine Presence, the more intelligence there will be at the symbolic level, because the symbolizing egoic mind is taken in by its very sense of intelligence and it falls for the rationalizations of the “I of the statement,” the superficial false self, and considers them valid . And so, the mind, for all its sophistication, becomes gullible and naïve. It foolishly believes the words that it hears coming from its own mouth or mind, and it looses touch with who is speaking. We must discern not only the words that are coming out of our mouths, but the level of subjectivity that is enunciating those words.It is when we recognize the “I of the enunciation” behind the words as a hidden object within, that we can begin to listen from an even deeper place, in a state of pure awareness that is not egoic. Once we awaken to the Self that is behind the enunciating ego, the third ear that is listening, and that is within the Real Self, we can begin to see the Real in everyone. Then the illusory paradigms of discourse will no longer fool us into believing in unrealities.But the primary unreality that we must overcome is the unreality of the ego, the self-identification with a linguistically centered program rooted in an body image. The surrender to pure Presence that is beyond language enables us to touch into the power of Being, which is known as love.The more we sit in meditation, with an active but silent awareness, we have not become mind-less but mind-ful. We have awakened the greater mind, the mind of silence that has direct intuition of the Real. It does not have to think about the Real, because it is That.The more that we are in that state, the more peaceful, serene we feel, the more unshakeable we are, the less prone to any kind of emotional rollercoaster or oscillation, the more we are free from depression, anxiety, and all the other pathologies that the egoic discursive mind is subject to.The ego mind lacks true Being, it is identified with appearances and constructs, and therefore is prone to believing in whatever delusional thoughts, images, and charged emotional scenarios arise in it. The egoic mind can be taken over, it can be possessed, whereas pure Presence can never be possessed by any lesser power, because it is at one with the ultimate reality.Presence is the Real that gave birth to the ego, sustains it, and must now refine it, purify it, and dissolve it back into the Supreme Self from which all emerged. The spiritual journey begins when one is bored with the ego, with its sufferings, and with all of the houses of cards that it can create.Consciousness understands the uses of egoic capacities, but it also understands their limitations, and now it wants something more, there is a hunger for the Absolute, for a meaning that transcends meaning itself, that transcends the limited paradigms that are based upon an organismic-centered reality, and wants to know the higher reality of the cosmos, the ultimate reality that was there before there was a cosmos, and that ultimate Real is not somewhere else, it is here and now.When consciousness is willing to let go of its attachment to mentally grasping the world, it realizes that it is in fact one with the source and the power that is the creative manifestation of the world, and it is the sacrifice of its worldly appearance into its Essence that is the most difficult challenge.As we proceed in the process of Self-enquiry, not through trying to understand the Self philosophically, metaphysically, but through simple Presence, the benefits of this letting-go become palpable. They give us such an exalted experience and imperience of what is true, and finally the power to overcome all of those tendencies of the mind that could not be overcome from within the ego, so that the limited identity can finally be let go of easily.At that moment, the transcendence of form into the formless takes place. In that transcendence there is also a transcendence of the duality between form and the formless, there is a recognition that the formless is form, the emptiness is all, the universe is Brahman, they are not two, they are not even one, this is the zero-point where all and nothing merge, and it is at this point that the Supreme Real is truly realized.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nPhilosophyYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 21:28:10	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.417042	2025-10-28 15:31:24.417042	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

To win this, we must increase our level of intelligence and activate our latent paranormal powers. That means we must leave behind the obsolete ego-mind and attain the innermost levels of the Self. The Core Self is within us now, and when we attune to That, we feel completely free and unbound, and able to download amazing insights. Knowledge is power. If you understand what is happening now in the world as an awesome opportunity rather than a threat, pushing us to higher consciousness, then you will profit greatly from the end of the current world age. This investment offers far more return than bitcoin. But the cost is letting go of all chosen forms of self-enslavement, including fear itself.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/0a-220110_Bitchute-Anarchapulco-Teaching-Option-2.png	\N	2022-02-21 17:06:42	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.13156	2025-10-28 15:31:24.13156	[]	["i43gv-11b1803-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This is Shunyamurti’s introduction and reflections on the film.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	As part of our ongoing film studies at Sat Yoga, we screened HEAL, a documentary by Kelly Noonan Gores which explores the power of the mind to heal the body.  This is Shunyamurti’s introduction and reflections on the film.Heal is a documentary about new age approaches to healing bodily illness with the power of the mind. What is shown is valid and well known. For those who are new to this field, it will be very moving and possibly life changing—and even life extending.But there are certain problems with the film due mostly to errors of omission that create a distorted and limited frame of reference that we should keep in mind.First of all, there is little sense of the true history of spiritual healing. All religions at their core are approaches to healing the soul—through attainment of union with God or Ultimate Reality, or at least accord, resonance, and atonement. It has been recognized since the dawn of time that physical dis-ease is at its root spiritual.Thus, the main miracles performed by the Jesus of the gospels are acts of healing, including through removal of evil spirits; and to the extreme of bringing back to life one who was already dead. These sorts of miraculous healing stories were common in the ancient world, and even today there are many spiritual healers of renown in all parts of the world, most of whom are doing their work in religious contexts.\nThe Raising of Lazarus an Italian fresco by Giotto (1304) In the modern world, numerous secular forms of mental healing have come into being. The most famous is probably the work of Franz Anton Mesmer in eighteenth century France, who successfully healed thousands of patients using the power of what he called “animal magnetism.” Today, it would probably be referred to as prana or chi. His work was threatening to the medical establishment and he was forced into exile and retirement. The same thing happened to Wilhelm Reich in more recent times, imprisoned for his discovery of orgone energy.\nMany people do not realize the long history of the therapeutic use of hypnosis, either. But it was employed in the British Raj in surgery—due to a lack of chemical anesthesia in the field—and resulted in better outcomes than doctors were getting from the same kind of surgery performed in London with the aid of anesthesia.“Let us allow the wisdom, love, healing energy, and unifying presence of the Absolute to live through us.” ~ ShunyamurtiSigmund Freud was a neurologist in Vienna who studied hypnosis with the great psychiatric pioneer Charcot in Paris, and later he discovered he was able to use the technique to cure his patients who suffered from what he called hysterical paralysis.As he deepened his research into the nature of hysteria, he discovered a great deal about the subconscious mind, which led to a change of methodology from hypnosis to free association, which revealed much more of the roots of trauma locked in repressed memories, the remembering and working through of which led to rapid healing of physical illness as well as mental disturbance.\nThe painting “A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière” by Pierre Aristide André Brouillet. This painting shows Charcot demonstrating hypnosis on a “hysterical” Salpêtrière patient, “Blanche” (Marie “Blanche” Wittmann), who is supported by Dr. Joseph Babiński (rear).\nThe field of psychoanalysis has deeply studied for over a century now the subject of psychosomatic illness, its underlying psychic structure, its dynamics and the triggering factors, and its treatment. But psychoanalysis was completely left out of this documentary. In fact, many schools of psychology and psychotherapy have been excluded from the investigation into healing explored in this film. That is unfortunate, because some cases of illness do require adept and intensive psychoanalytically-informed treatment if healing is to be achieved.There is one line spoken by the narrator saying that the new age approaches being shown are more effective than “talk therapy,” as if there is only one type of talk therapy, and as if the approaches being shown are also not mostly talk. The question of what kind of talk heals was not very deeply explored.In addition, the theoretical understanding of both the subconscious and super-conscious levels of the mind is barely touched. The focus is on conscious belief, faith, and intention. There is occasional reference to the subconscious, but not enough to give a full picture of the significance of consciousness in its total spectrum of activity and potentiality.The film asks toward the end about the illnesses of infants and children, and wonders about the reality of karma, but there is no scientific investigation of that phenomenon, even though there have been many studies of the spontaneous past life memories of children and the documentation of their validity. There is also a great deal of information about the subject of karma in the esoteric texts of such traditions as kabbalah, alchemy, Buddhism, and Eastern Orthodox Christianity.Moreover, there is little mention in the film of homeopathy, a very successful form of healing practice, which allopathic medical associations sought to destroy in the U.S. for decades, and nothing about its theoretical underpinnings. But there is a good deal of information about the placebo effect. However, they are not the same.There is a lot of focus on diet and other lifestyle changes, visualization, prayer, and energy healing, the reality and healing potency of near death experiences, featuring of course Anita Moorjani, and a particular, if somewhat primitive, therapeutic approach involving tapping the face of the patient with one’s fingers while having her repeat affectively charged sentences.There is also a lumping together of different forms of healing, some of which involve only the transmission of energy and others which include psychic surgery of various kinds, a la John of God.Only at the end does the film come to focus on meditation, which is really at the center of all the other methods, at least on the part of the practitioner. The explanation of the effectiveness of meditation is laid more at the feet of neurological factors than spiritual ones.Alas, the film also avoids dealing with such more subtle aspects of healing as the intersubjective dimensions of healing work, the power of the field phenomenon in all the senses in which noetic, morphogenetic, and energy fields of various kinds are involved, the profound attractors that emerge as teleological factors in healing, the function of dreams and the power of oneiric work, the force of the drives, and the decisive effect of the Will of God. Of course, all the above are deployed in the practice of Atmanology, which for some reason is not mentioned in the film.Despite the many omissions and the limited paradigm, this film offers a useful introduction to the reality of healing the body with the resources of consciousness.

Shunyamurti opens the evening by clarifying the meaning of the Balm of Gilead, dovetailing into the connection between medical and culinary arts and how these fit into spirituality, noting that the ultimate sacrament and purpose of our lives is to be eaten by God, which means no longer trying to hide from God but making yourself delicious to God (loving, truthful) and cultivating a relationship to God so that you can be re-flowered by the blissful penetration of the Absolute.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/4.-Friday-Nov-20-Members-Teaching-If-You-Want-to-Be-Eaten-by-God-Be-Delicious-201021_Rainy-Season-Retreat_Evening-Teaching-QA-1.png	\N	2020-11-20 14:55:28	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.212683	2025-10-28 15:31:24.212683	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

If you don’t have a deep love for God, you won’t enjoy meditation, and you won’t enjoy life very much—and you won’t be able to discover who you are, because the God you don’t love is your Self. The gods that the ego does love are idols that it worships that don’t bring salvation.

Now, the term “diamond mind” is used in Buddhism and other traditions, but I’m going to give a slightly different signification for it. At the ego level, you’ve got four basic emotions that are presentable in public that people tend to alternate: You can be sad, mad, glad, or scad. OK, scad means you’re really “scad” of something—that’s a New York accent for “scared”. . . . But that’s only the, let’s say, the visible spectrum of emotional light, if you wish.

But, not “the truth” as some intellectual formulation, but the Truth as supreme love, light, power, generosity, understanding, and the power to redream maya, which seems to the ego to be reality, but is illusion. To those who are in maya—illusion—some will be happy to hear the Truth. Some will be angry. Some will be frightened. Some will doubt. Some will be confused. Some will reject. Some will deny. Some will celebrate. Some will go into instant bliss—and every other possible permutation of reaction. But none of that must be allowed to prevent the ongoing flow of Truth. Because only Truth will set you free from maya. But hearing the Truth won’t do it; you have to internalize it. You have to make it real. You have to practice it, and you have to refuse to indulge in the ego’s maya, in the ego’s enjoyments that cause it to forget the truth, and to go on with its trajectory of suffering, and believe that that is reality.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/07/God’s-Test-Choose-the-Corona-or-the-Virus.jpg	\N	2020-03-27 14:53:11	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.242128	2025-10-28 15:31:24.242128	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

When that engram is activated, all bets are off: the ego is capable of anything. Around that engram, as protective shells, are two outer spheres. The outermost one we could call “stimulus”, and the second one we could call “signal”. If one becomes aware of a stimulus, it is a very soft indication that there is, in the neighborhood, the possibility of an engram of need being activated. And that can be dealt with either through a collusion of desire, or through an outburst of anger, or through simply ignoring and moving out of range of the stimulus…	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/07/Deactivating-the-Engram-of-Need.jpg	\N	2020-03-03 14:39:54	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.244098	2025-10-28 15:31:24.244098	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

And isn’t the definition of the ego, simply consciousness captured in the gaze of an other?And therefore, liberation can only be the recognition that there is another other, in whose gaze you live.

At the lowest and densest level of the spectrum there seems to be a multiplicity of individual, personal consciousnesses. And in the middle of the spectrum there seems to be a struggle of consciousness to extract itself from the illusion of the person, and as that extraction becomes more complete, there is an imperience of shakti, of divine energy that seems to fill the consciousness from its own beyond. But at the unchanging Source of consciousness, the real truth of consciousness is that it is always already free, completely liberated with no need of struggle, because there is nothing other than consciousness….	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/3.jpg	\N	2019-12-05 16:26:27	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.253251	2025-10-28 15:31:24.253251	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

And the determination to live in Truth means to kill the tendency to want to live in untruth, which is called the ego.

And as it gets closer to the light, its love grows in accord with its fear, and the love and the fear become one, and at some point the moth cannot live without becoming one with the flame. And in that moment that the moth enters the flame and that its wings are set on fire, and its whole body is taken over by the combustion of the flame—at that moment—just for one instant—the moth knows what it is to be the flame.

So many allusions to recent teachings could of course be mentioned. It is about the game of pool, which involves disappearance and death, but also growth of character and facing the deepest pain, thus becoming the Bodhisattva of Compassion.\nWe could mention the writing on the mirror (I won’t say more, so not to spoil it) that includes the word “perverted,” and perhaps understand it in the context of the perversion that is the twisted root of every ego.We can also view the film as showing us Kali Yuga headed for a cataclysm. The film lays out the full disgusting display of the rotten core the empire of modernity. Our faces are shoved into the waste of deadened consciousness, the corruption of life in the good old USA, the barren desert of the real, where the only way to make a decent buck is to become an indecent human being.The film takes us into a kumbha mela of criminality, where we loiter with the pool sharks, their slimy managers, the bouncers and the hit men; not to mention the whores and the chambermaids, the hangers-on and the houseboys, the paid musicians and cabbies, all the field hands who hold the system all together.But still the whole contraption depends on character. It needs a champion. But it is also terrified of champions, because real champions would destroy the system, as Samson tried to do, after he woke up from being captured by it.

The title of the film is Bab’Aziz: The Prince Who Contemplated His Soul. Bab’Aziz is the name of the protagonist. The prince is only one of the characters in the stories that he tells and that is intermixed with the story that is unfolding before our three eyes. If we are non-judgmental (because this film no doubt stinks by Hollywood criteria), we will come to inhabit the strange and barren desert umwelt depicted here, a surreal realm alive with hidden oases and lost kingdoms, the heartbreaking tragicomedy of spiritual illumination, and the awesome beauty of our already finalized marriage with Death. At some point, our third eye pops open with the awakened recognition that we are watching a telling of our own life stories, a cross-section of our psychological development laid out in mythic form. The film is the third segment of a trilogy (I have not seen the others) by a Tunisian auteur who strives to capture the lost taste of the divine madness of the Sufi darveeshes. The Sufis thrived in the Middle Ages. Now they are an oppressed and hunted group considered heretic by Wahhabi strains of Islam. Sufism may be more alive in the West than in the East, though Westerners are still beginners, untrained in the inner craft of transformation. But the great Sufi Shaykhs of the 11th and 12th centuries (by Christian calendar) were the unexcelled alchemists of the spirit, whose accomplishments have altered the morphogenetic field of our planetary reality, and have made accessible to us the salvific wisdom by which our world shall be redeemed. Bab’Aziz is an oriental Decameron or Canterbury Tales. Every character in the film corresponds to an element of consciousness within the Self. We begin our story in the vast desert, right after a sandstorm that has buried our ancient spiritual guide in the flying earth particles of dancing doom among the dunes. He is being dusted off by his traveling partner, his little granddaughter named, of course, Ishtar. She is loyal to him, but admits at the beginning of their odyssey that she nearly left him to return to her pet turtle—a symbol of the threat of psychological regression that always lurks in the shadows, so long as the ego remains at large. Of course, a Sufi guide must be blind to the outer world, in order to see fully in the inner. So the old man can be a proxy for your awakened soul, still dragging around its inner child ego, completing its karmic assignment. The child is afraid of being lost, but our hero calmly tells her that a soul at peace is never lost. Where they are walking is to a gathering of Sufi darveeshes. But our hero does not know where or when this marriage celebration of divinely intoxicated saints betrothed to Ultimate Reality is to take place—nor does anyone else. He only knows that his steps will unerringly take him there, or to whatever station he is assigned along the way. Regardless, he is always already the place where the meeting happens, in the Heart of the Beloved. If you watch this film tenderly, as if your own child made it for you as a gift, there are many gems to be found here. Some are difficult to extract, because they come only as images, like that of the gazelle, without bothering to unpack the many (a thousand and one) Arabian mystery tales starring a gazelle as an adoptive mother, or as the leaping agile soul escaping demonic predators, in perfect harmony with the Real, and yet remaining humble and pure, at one with the Creator. Those who are invited to the vertical dimension will gain many blessings from receiving these archetypal images, even as indistinct messages. It may be noted that our saint is assaulted early on by a man angry at a dervish for stealing the love (and the life) of his brother. It is a case of mistaken identity on one level, but on another it is an accurate charge. He has stolen his own life in order to offer it to God. While he is building a small fire to keep Ishtar warm, she asks Bab’Aziz to tell her a gazelle story. Instead, he tells a tale of the prince who becomes enchanted, not with dancing girls or other sensory pleasures—with those he is disenchanted—but with his own consciousness, with the depths of his Being. Thus, the prince loses interest in the world; he is lost. Or does he begin to be found? Since the prince is also the gazelle, his soul, who is the silent icon that sits at the center of of the saga of the soul, this is also Bab’Aziz in his youth, the beginning phase of his own adult illumination. He exits his exalted social role by chasing a gazelle into the outback. To the others in his kingdom (his kin-dom), he has merely gone mad. His madness shows up as the sudden intrusion of the modern world. Supposedly in the remote sand dunes uncrossable except by camel, the unpleasant engine noise of a motor vehicle is heard, and then a bus roars by on a road not hitherto seen. One would think the contemplation of the soul would lead one backward in time, not forward, and into purer archetypes. But no, one’s karma must be lived out first, on one plane or another. This is the function of kali yuga. Soon we meet the next character, a devotee, in pomo attire as a nomadic backpacker, singing mystical songs of longing for the Beloved. Here is his animus, who will quest until he finds her, his anima-Other, the inner bringer of the bliss of love. His heart is magnetically drawn toward the Fire. As Bab’Aziz says, every soul uses her most precious gift to find her way. For his soul, it was devotional music, the singing of love songs to the Lord, Who responds by sending a messenger in the form of the goddess. Shakti brings one to Shiva, to the Union of the Two Forms of the Absolute, outer and inner. It is a function, not a flaw in the design. But the function can miscarry, if it is not treated with utmost delicacy and divine consideration, based on a mature recognition of the multidimensionality of meanings that pour through the deck of Archetypal cards that make up the ethereal arcana. This felix culpa befalls the next character. I will let the film tell you that story directly, it is already all too well known. Before that, Bab’Aziz is asked if the soul will one day know everything, all of Reality. He ponders. He knows he cannot know if all is known, so long as he is the receiver of Knowledge, and not its Dispenser. This insight leads immediately to the joyous devotional dancing of Ishtar, who begins to remember she is the child goddess. Even old Bab’Aziz starts to dance. The ego is being shed in the bliss of the great adventure that is Life. The child ego asserts itself more and more, and comes quickly to the mastery of survival skills. Individuation is shown by her amicably divided love, between her sage grandfather and her image of the syzygy, the union of anima and animus. But a rupture is inevitable. The same rupture is fractally located at the adult animus level, dividing love between chakra four and chakra two. Thus, one becomes the man who fell into the well. Enough said. His healing requires him to tell the tale to the old man, just like the ancient mariner had to tell his sad tale of albatross abuse as penitence for his mortal sin. In fact this telling, and the listening, the hearing with the third ear, makes him an old man, finally, sitting on the other side of the therapy room. It makes him able to bury his fantasies once and for all. But what he buries first is his paternal superego. Now he is able to live for himself, at last. But what day-job does he take up? He becomes a sand courier, bringing a worthless product to those who have ordered it with ulterior motives. His best customer is the scribe. In other words, the naïve ego brings his sense of unworthiness to his symbolic capacity, and learns to transform his suffering into poetry and philosophy. The scribe opens his creative imagination, all right, but he loses touch with the distinction between dimensions, between celestial metaphors and music, on the one hand, and the temptation to pose as an animal, on the other. The sound track of the Heart opening to love is irresistible. First the sweet-voiced dreams, the butterflies, all the magical adornments—and then the karmic backlash—and the soul falls, dives headlong, into the parallel universe of pain. The loneliness, abandonment, of the outcast scapegoat, savagely ripped apart by passion—but did he not get a foretaste of paradise for his investment? He got as well the obligatory penance time of wandering in the desert that all prophets seem to have to suffer. Interestingly enough, his exodus begins with a vision of the burning bush in the distance, in the barren wasteland, that he is led to believe is the caravan of love in which he will ride with his beloved. Worlds are lost, while other worlds are gained, as we make our choices in life which open doors that close behind us as we go. The rite of passage is never-ending. Not until the final door to God’s innermost chamber opens up before you. As the film makes clear, most go through the desert only looking for the lost object from the past, never facing the Real Other Who is calling us now. Some lucky souls are allowed to travel via the mountains, and some upon the oceans, and they stop to visit only the Painted Desert. In any case, it is time for the child ego to grow up into soulhood and realize her greatness. She recognizes the artwork in the mosque to refer to her divinity. Then she lifts up the veil the pious female to see the mystery of Womanhood, the Archetype of the Feminine, the power of the face, the voice, the energy, the beckoning of both the vertical and horizontal, seeking the integration that can only come from the annihilation of the seeker. The child ascends to the roof, from which vantage point she sees the graceful gazelle waiting in the distance, and now commences her own journey as her adolescent character passes through the barzakh, the psychic barrier, that had separated her from her mature empowerment, and she is absorbed into her Self-given authority to develop fully her magical powers. She does it by getting lost. This seems to be the only way people transform. And of course we grow in the inside first, before we are strong enough to express our truth outwardly as well, and before we even know all that it implies. So Ishtar returns to the nest, but in a fever. Her swoon is guided by her animus lover, who tells the story of his projection of divine love of the anima into manifest form, and Ishtar lives through his dream, and through the waking dream now possessed of that romantic theme. Secretly, she learns the subtle secrets of love. How does the man win the competition, how to sing and sling with such accuracy the arrows of love that the heart of the beloved can be conquered? Not a song of longing and exile, or secret allusions to his unspeakable desire; no, he wins her with a song of ecstasy, with all the atoms of the world on fire with love, of total penetration and permeation by the blissful light of the Supreme Sun, the Light from which we all have come, but the splendor of which had been lost. He lit her up, and the tears of love signaled her consent. And yet it was consent to another exile, another test of faith, passing the test of time. And of course he must also ace the exam of taking care of her black kitten as he trudges ever further into the desert of the Real. The anima absorbs the symbolic phallus of the animus and now she can dress as a man. She will conquer the man’s world and live free of temptation or weakness. They can only meet again as a single voice. But the child imprint remains in superposition with the adult. The fever continues. Child, kitten, and archetypal feminine are in resonance. Thus, the brew of love must ferment, and boil, and integrate all the spices that make up its recipe. It must be consecrated to Allah. Love must be made sacred once again. Love has a task to fulfill. It must become Life itself. All the pairs of opposites must come together. The betrayer and the betrayed must celebrate their supporting acts that coincide as co-egocide. But are we willing to burn in that holy fire, to leave our psychological bones to decompose in the empty wilderness? Now comes the first visit to the cemetery—this one is only the death of projection, of belief in the reality of the world. In dying to the sensory plane of otherness, the sage is able to raise the spirits of the dead, to awaken the djinn. In other words, he is empowered as a Bodhisattva, a Sufi shaykh, a swami siddha, who is granted higher authority by Allah in order to serve at a larger level and historic scope. And then comes the grand finale, separation from life, the reabsorption into Eternity, while yet life goes on as if nothing had happened, because nothing had. New stories are born, in which the old mythologies reappear, world after world. But the moment of death is the gathering up, the kumbha mela of the caliphs of the spirit, who have completed their journey through the Mind of God. And now the celebration starts in earnest. Within magic circles of light, the singing and the dancing, Dionysian yet Apollonian, uninhibited yet solemn satsangs, frenetic yet ecstatic elegies to Allah, Elohim, the Absolute. But the songs are also to Sophia, goddess of the Sufi orders. And the most stirring are entranced surrenderings to the Love that has no name. At this brazen party, avatars emerge, through souls possessed by Krishna, Kalki, Idris, Adam, every Atom dancing with the atmic goddesses and dakinis, and all the prophets beating on their drums and plucking pizzicatos on their heart strings and vocal cords with pranic pulchritude. But no sound can satisfy, except the voice of the Beloved. And even that angelic timbre falls silent at the sight of its reflection. The contemplation of the soul attains apotheosis despite, or because of, the wall that separates, and thus subsumes their particularity into the Universal, the collective illumination of the Night of Time, as God awakens the Earth and collects all souls in preparation for the Dawn about to break upon the world. Our shaykh, Bab’Aziz, lets his hair down one last time, having completed his task and ready for the grave and for the Great Beyond. The gazelle serenely watches over him, as he shuffles off his mortal coil. But not before the Sufi serves his final sermon on the mound of burial. He speaks with compassion to his still fearful identity as carnal creature, terrified of death and the unfathomable infinity of consciousness. The soul lets go of its last tether to the dream, and vanishes into the Mystery. May our own fearful ego vanish likewise as we accompany this Selfic symbol, our Being’s reflection in the water of life, as it dissolves back into the Source, vicariously, through this cinematic Hajj that shouts haji to humanity, re-dreaming heavens heaping with every happiness. Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nEast & WestEastern CultureFilm StudiesMythology	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/7-1.png	\N	2020-05-20 15:24:37	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.328099	2025-10-28 15:31:24.328099	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

He brought a generation along on a ride to chakra four, to the opening of the Heart and the emanation of unconditioned love. Not everyone decided to stay in that frequency, but some made it their new baseline, and from there they caught all the hints thrown out by Ram Dass and free-climbed up the kundalini ladder to chakra seven.His life was an important fractal in the morphogenetic holofield. He produced a new, kinder and gentler archetype of the Jewish-American upper bourgeois intellectual who became a universal human work in progress, demonstrating both the power of the performativity paradox, and the heart-softening grace that comes from surrender to love. Ram Dass became one of the last role models of living spirituality that captured the global imagination. He lived in accord with principles that kept him in the service of Truth. He lived a calling that carried the sense of responsibility to uphold the Dharma, even when his ego failed to rise to the occasion. He made every fall into a learning and then a teaching. He knew how to turn the poison into nectar. And he conveyed the proper way to carry out the great work of Alchemy, always sitting in the sacrificial fire with a smile.It is a joy to say good-bye one more time to our old friend Ram Dass, and perhaps shed a tear and a prayer for his luminous ascension. He has earned the right to apply for graduation. But on the other hand, we’d love him to return.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/02/WEEKLY-TEACHING-YOUTUBE-THUMB-1.jpg	\N	2020-02-15 16:24:59	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.331382	2025-10-28 15:31:24.331382	[]	[]	["IhyQNqkOgPk"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The ghost of delusion increases its intensity of terror by the ambivalence and self-doubt it shines into its victim with a blinding ray of darkness. The spell-binding film, made in 1961 in France, by Jean Rouch, entitled Chronique d’un Été (Chronicle of a Summer) is such a weapon of egoic destabilization. Rouch had been a cultural anthropologist, studying with the famous Marcel Griaule, whose fame arose from his study of the Dogon tribe in Africa that seemed to know more about the star system Sirius than did modern astronomers—and who claimed their ancestors are from a planet in that system. Rouch preferred to study the people of Niger, Ghana, and Cote d’Ivoire, who were then gaining their independence from colonial masters. He was interested in the tensions between rulers and subjects, men and women, workers and bosses, people of different skin color, different political leanings, different levels of investment in the course of human history or in their psychological self-awareness. Then he started to make anthropological film studies of French culture. This film is now a classic. Yet, the movie is often considered both a failure and a breakthrough. Of course such judgments are not to be taken as more than indications of boundaries that Rouch did not dare cross, as well as those he did. He made the film in Paris at a time when many truths were not spoken, were not allowed to be spoken, or were too unbearable to explore, or impossible to explain. Society is an agreement to remain alienated from truths that would explode its hypocrisies and destroy the constructed order. It is a deceptive and deranged disorder masquerading as order, and enforced by thought police who play very rough indeed. But once revealed as fictional, that social order could no longer impose a master’s discourse to force the population to consent to inhumanity exposed to the light of public awareness—at least that is the implicit thesis and motivation of Jean Rouch. He turns his anthropologist’s discerning eye upon the French soul. He puts under his microscope their narcissism, their moral cowardice, their hollow lives of no essence or meaning. We feel the self-loathing, the envy, the fear, the despair and loneliness of every being. The film is shot when the trauma of the recent World War was still agonizing. To face not only the military defeat of France, but its moral defeat, its submission to the Nazi ideology, ate away at their guts like acid. One had to cope with the knowledge of those who flagrantly collaborated with the Nazis, and those who fought in the Resistance or falsely claimed they did. One also had to face the eyes of those French Jews who had been turned in to the government, which sent them to concentration camps in Germany, and who had after the war returned to Paris. One could not deny the tattooed numbers on their arms. But worse, it was the time when the Algerian War was raging. The people of Algeria were fighting for freedom from colonial rule by France. A policy of massacres and torture by the French Armed Forces was underway, and all French people recognized they were accomplices in this terrorism and mass murder. There were many points in the film when it seemed too glib and superficial. One wishes the interviewer would have pushed deeper, demanded more self-revelation, or taken his questions in different directions. But he went as far as he could without his film being banned. There are famous out-takes that showed that Rouch did go much further in certain interviews, but he had to cut them. They were too politically dangerous, or too morally shaming, or just too gut wrenching, and possibly even destabilizing of the audience. He made his point. The film pioneered a movement to be known as cinéma vérité. Rouch’s work formed part of the larger cinematic artistic approach that is remembered as Nouvelle Vague, New Wave. The wave has now receded. And although the filmmakers of today have more special effects to play with, and more leeway of political tolerance—at least in some aspects of life—there is too little interest in truth any longer in the arts. At least, no truth that reveals the falseness of the ego, and the moral imperative of goodness and Self realization, shines through the arts very strongly in these dark days at the end of Kali Yuga. It is important for us to remember the function of art, and for ourselves to become great artists of Truth, whose lives reveal the nobility and courage of the human spirit to overcome its greed, its fear, and its narcissism, and take responsibility for bringing beauty to life and igniting a transformation of our world through the purity of divine love, before it is too late. Who will film a chronicle of our summer in Sat Yoga—and what would such a film reveal about our own willingness to transcend the lies and weaknesses of the ego and fully live in and as the Spirit of Truth? Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nArts & CultureFilm StudiesWestern Culture	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/01/8.png	\N	2020-01-14 16:32:58	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.333895	2025-10-28 15:31:24.333895	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But in technical terms, it was only a singspiel, a shorter more popular form (meaning aimed at the common person as audience) and a mixture of song and dialogue, involving more of a focus on character and plot, and slightly less on the power of sound itself.The libretto for the work was written by Emanuel Schikaneder, the leader of a theatrical troupe that was resident in one of the major opera houses in Vienna at the time. Mozart himself conducted the orchestra and his sister-in-law played one of the lead roles. It was a great popular success from its opening night, and remains so to this day among audiences for opera.However, there is great controversy over why it is so popular or even what it is really about. Many theories can be found, asserting such opinions as that the play is a subversive political commentary on the Empress Maria Theresa, or a conservative call for enlightened absolutism, as it was called, and against the tendencies of republicanism. Modern theorists have attacked it for its racism and anti-feminism. But no consistent case can be made for any such hypotheses. And so, other commentators have simply ridiculed the opera for being a naïve and childish fairy tale aimed at unlettered audiences, a kind of dumbed-down Disney-fication of Western mythology avant la lettre.The more Freudian commentators, of course, see in the magic flute only a phallic symbol, to help him in his Oedipal passage into a higher symbolic manhood, and in the bells given to Papageno a new pair of testicles to help him grow into a more courageous and faithful manhood. But this focus on male psychology is also clearly a very one-sided view and does not fairly evaluate the feminine side of the operatic equation. Jungians likewise offer their archetypal theories, which are no doubt closer to the truth, but still do not give a coherent account of the action.Still others focus on the names of characters, such as Sarastro, the high priest and leader of the secret spiritual brotherhood, and assume that he is modeled on Cagliostro, a contemporary mystic and séance leader. Others say Sarastro refers to Zarathustra, the prophet of the dualistic Zoroastrian religion, which influenced a number of Christian heretical sects, beginning with Manichaeism. But this conflicts with the equally obvious presence of signifiers of ancient Egyptian religion, including references to Isis and Osiris, and the symbol of the pyramid. The music has also been analysed as reflective of numerological Pythagorean symbolic messages, including the employment of the key of E Flat, with its three flat chords to emphasize the Law of Three, which appears in many forms in the unfoldment of the play, and the Law of Seven, which combines, as does the pyramid, both the Three and the Four (as the four elements of Nature), in four triangles that meet at the highest point.All of these theories come up short as complete explanations of the meaning of the drama we are to witness. But what is a documented fact is that Mozart was an active Freemason, was associated with the Illuminati, he was knowledgeable about such esoteric symbolic systems as alchemy, Kabbalah, Renaissance neoplatonic philosophy, ancient Egyptian Hermetic philosophy, and other occult sciences. Mozart was a contemporary of Goethe, another well-read master of the esoteric traditions, who publicly recognized the opera as aimed at initiates, who alone would understand it, and the rest would assume it was a silly patchwork of themes from fairy tales.So how can we best make use of this spectacle as Sat Yogis? I suggest we consider ourselves undergoing our own initiation into a mystery school, into the deepest secrets of the nature of reality. Indeed, culture was initially centered on such mystery-guarding institutions that were responsible for transmitting the knowledge, the maturity, the virtue, and the power of higher consciousness, in short, the capacity for sustaining the Dharma of a healthy community from one generation to the next.Thus, although we can analyze the opera at an exoteric level and find useful if clichéd teachings in it, as are employed somewhat crassly in this version in the form of literal pop-ups of apothegms and aphorisms, and we can also find mesoteric references to teachings of masonic derivation, we can make most use of this great work to view it on the most esoteric level possible.In this paradigm, we can recognize it as expressing nondual reality, from both the perspective of Brahman and that of Atman. All the characters belong to the single consciousness of the Whole. The play shows the Great Chain of Command. But the world, Samsara, has gotten out of order, and now a restoration of Dharma is required. The masculine and feminine principles are at war, the relationship between Nature and Spirit has become inaccurate, and the resistance to growth, transcendence of ego, and sustenance of the power of divine love has become overwhelming. The play shows that all the different esoteric traditions have the same message and the same divine intention. The magic flute is an ancient symbol that goes back to Krishna and beyond. It is also the power of pure speech, transmitting Wisdom that casts a spell of liberation upon the ego and releases the Real Self into full awakening and illumination. The Self returns to rule the manifest world as its own infinite reflection in form of its formless supreme Presence.So in the first scene, we face the initial situation. Man has been overcome by the Beast. The lower chakras have human consciousness on the run. The best of men is unable to fight off the dragon of lust. His masculinity is out of balance. It requires the feminine power of soulful love to control his animalistic sexual drive. But in accepting the help of the feminine principle, he also comes under the influence of the female fury at the male principle that has allowed the situation to become so oppressive and dictatorial, so objectifying and defiling of the goddess. The feminine projection of anti-male anger must also be balanced. Thus, the symbolic guides on the initiatory journey are three young boys, who remain innocent but fully male in their attitudes and influence.The Shadow is represented by Monostatos (One-Dimensional Man), who wants to sexually defile Pamina, but who is held back, just barely, by the Law. Papageno is the male ego in its more socialized form, but it remains infantile and unable to go through a full transformation. The ego is only capable of supporting the sexual relationship at a level that can parent children, but cannot function as a spiritual guide for society. It remains narcissistic, even though loyal to the higher guidance in its way.But Tamino symbolizes the Buddhi, who goes through the various ordeals of celibacy, of self-restraint, of silence, in order to attain an inner unification of the divine masculine with the divine feminine at the level of pure Spirit. The purification of the consciousness leads once more to the renewal of the world. The old order of ego, of anger, projection, and conflict between the man and the woman is overcome dialectically, and the unification of Nature, Reason, and Wisdom becomes manifest. The conditions of a new Sat Yuga have been attained, and the transmission of power can now ensue. This is the coronation of the new king and queen, and the abdication of Sarastro, having completed his own charitra, his own divine act of deliverance.

When the yogi attains permanent Samadhi (usually referred to as sahaja nirvikalpa Samadhi) then this becomes the only state, which subsumes all the rest—and this ultimate state is referred to as “beyond the fourth” or turiyatita.Clearly, this model is insufficient for an accurate understanding of the nature, permutations, and trajectory of evolution of personal into transpersonal and finally liberated consciousness. It is offered only as an interesting museum piece helping us to understand consciousness in a simple way that can be communicated to a naïve beginner. The real picture is much more complex. It may be useful to attempt to formulate an alternative model.Let us refer to phases as unfoldments on the same level of consciousness, the levels referring to ego, soul, and atman, or Self. States would refer to discontinuous appearances and irruptions of phenomena from different levels, coming as intrusions into and disruptions of a normal mode of psychic unfoldment. (We could also add registers of consciousness into the model—the knotted intersections of imaginary, symbolic, and real that constitute the ego and the soul levels of consciousness. But we will leave them out of this analysis for reasons of simplification.)Sat Yoga postulates the following:From the biological perspective, we can say that indeed there are three ordinary phases of consciousness for the human organism that alternate as a function of the optimal circadian rhythm supporting the vital processes of the individual.But when we approach these three phases from a psychological perspective, we discover that there are many variations and sub-phases within each phase, plus interruptions in the form of mostly pathological states, in addition to the transitional phases that may or may not function optimally.So, for example, one may attempt to transition normally from deep sleep to wakefulness—this transitional phase has been called by Jungians the hypnopompic phase—but discover that one is stuck in an in-between state that is referred to as sleep paralysis. But one is obviously not asleep in the usual sense in this state. One is quasi-awake but not able to operate the body. The body does not respond to the conscious will of the mind. The body remains asleep while the mind is awake. The mind then becomes alarmed at its condition, and enters a fear state until the gears of the body mesh again and the organism awakens and becomes once more in sync with the mind’s intentions and its normal, though illusory, feeling of being at-one with the body.Sleep paralysis has similarities to the coma condition, except that it is transitory, while a coma can last for years or become terminal. Clearly the coma, and its short-term relative sleep paralysis, demonstrate that consciousness has only an occasional relationship to the physical organism, and that consciousness can enter into non-physical conditions in which it cannot return to the body by its own will.The transitional phase between waking and falling asleep—called the hypnogogic phase—can also be problematic, producing hallucinatory fears, repetitive affect-stimulating thoughts, fantasies, and paranoid anxieties of loss of control, and lead to insomnia and other chronic sleep disturbances.A variety of different sub-phases and abnormal states can occur within the sleep phase, including sleepwalking and night terrors, and other malignant forms of what is called parasomnia.Consciousness can also lead a separate life from that of the organism, as shown in such events as a near death experience, in which the consciousness not only separates from the body, and enters other, higher dimensions of reality, but returns with detailed memories of having gone to those other dimensions, where usually great wisdom and power were available and bestowed, and one retains afterward the new knowledge of the spiritual nature of reality and the higher laws of living that determine our destiny. The event will usually entail a palpable change in the attitude and character of the returnee, and often produces a miraculous healing of the returnee’s physical organism.There is also a psychological capacity that operates in an altered state of awareness called remote viewing—in which the person can sense or intuit locations extremely distant from the body, and sometimes events that are happening at those locations.There is also the well-known out-of-body experience, in which consciousness not only intuits what is happening at a distance, but actually experiences the reality of leaving the body and traveling in space in real time and being able to overhear conversations in distant places and perceive what is happening with the senses of sight and hearing fully functioning in the bodiless condition. One can train to achieve a full mastery of both remote viewing and the ability to engage in out-of-body movement in space so that one can do so at will without limitation, which is referred to as astral traveling.There are also reported experiences of time travel. And as with remote viewing, there is the more common phenomenon of receiving a vision of a future event, or sometimes just a premonition. This capacity can also be cultivated, which can lead to the ability to prophesy, or predict the future. A minor variant of this is the déjà vu, in which one has the sense of having already gone through an experience previously.There are many other permutations that occur in the waking phase of consciousness, leading to what are generally called altered states of consciousness, including those induced by the ingestion of psychoactive chemicals. Altered states can also be induced by hypnosis and other forms of trancework, rites and rituals, some including physical ordeals, some involving drumming or other kinds of music and dance, or heightened sexual arousal, and longer term and more gradual alterations of consciousness, such as that produced by long fasting, or by entering into radically different environmental conditions, as in deep diving or spacewalking as an astronaut.All the above phenomena relate to the ego and its illusory sense of being in a world that pre-exists its arrival. Beyond all this is the more subtle reality of the soul, which recognizes all that arises and changes to be its own dream, aspects of its nature viewed in projected form, being re-collected through understanding and acceptance into aboriginal unity.The kundalini yogi, functioning at the soul level, recognizes each of the seven chakras as signifying a different vibrational vortex that can suck consciousness into an egoless state ruled by the affect that is expressed in that frequency, and can enter into non-ordinary states that produce powerful effects on the body and its behavior, not all of which are positive.A chakra one vortex can lead to demonic realms, hallucinatory horrors of dismemberment and other torment, autism, psychosis, or even suicide.The chakra two vortex can lead to hypersexual acting out, nymphomania, fatal attractions, lustful thoughts that lead to porn addiction, compulsive masturbation, and obsessive focus on the sexual body parts of others or one’s own body.The chakra three vortex leads to one going berserk, in murderous rage, blind fury, and uncontrolled destructiveness.The chakra four vortex produces sublime feelings of divine love without an object.The chakra five vortex leads into a labyrinth of understanding and wisdom, symbolic insight into ever more subtle levels of truth.The vortex of chakra six manifests as light and power, the command of the elements, paranormal psychic capacities, full mastery of the brain and body’s potentialities.The chakra seven vortex is the portal to total liberation, absorption into the Supreme Real.What a traditionally-oriented advaita yogi is interested in is chakra seven, expanding consciousness beyond the limits of the ego, not through a projection of the ego into outer space, nor by the ego’s entering into temporary altered states through taking psychedelic substances or engaging in other kinds of trance induction, but by a total and permanent dissolution of the ego identity and its frame of reference—and timeless perfect realization of the Absolute.This leads to a hyper-dimensional shift of consciousness into an omnicentric egoless awareness of the entire apperceptual field and the boundless luminous intelligent void in which all of reality is contained and pervaded as a single whole, a unified manifestation of the Self. This state of aware presence is timeless, blissful, intuitively knowledge-filled, but in an implicate order that is the ground of Being, knowing in a thought-free manner in which knower and known are one.This is the final phase of the destiny of consciousness, recognized as a moebius strip in which samsara and nirvana seem to alternate, but are really the same, omnipresent and empty, without qualities, the Nirgun Para Brahman, yet also filled to overflowing with luminous love, joy and delight, the blissful Vaikuntha of Vishnu, a great work of infinite artistry and indescribable beauty, the nameless Tao, eternal yet evanescent and illusory, a perfect thought wave in the oceanic Buddha-nature mind of God: the Self.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nPhilosophyYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-02 17:33:43	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.337694	2025-10-28 15:31:24.337694	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Many clinical studies have validated the effectiveness of meditation not only for physical healing and the diminution of anxiety, but for the improvement of the quality of life. The sense of happiness and inner contentment has been correlated to the capacity to meditate and sustain states of serenity and stillness. But for the Sat Yogi, meditation implies a great deal more than that.Meditation is the transcendence of the ego. Through silencing the mind, that is, through stopping the production of thought-constructs, the awareness is able to enter higher states of Being. Awareness comes to realize itself as unbounded, formless, timeless freedom. The original and ultimate state of the Self is indescribable. The closest one can come to portraying the feeling nature of our essence is to use such terms as love, wonderment, joy, power, crystalline clarity, absolute emptiness, radiant presence, infinite intelligence, complete unity with all that is, and utter endless rapturous bliss.This transcendence is the final attainment of Sat Yoga. But for most people, meditation is very difficult in the beginning, and there is a long learning curve. This is because the ego-mind resists the state of inner silence. The ego is threatened by silence. To maintain its supremacy over the awareness, it must constantly weave its narrative thread, throwing out images of the past, replaying scenes and words with an emotional charge, fomenting anger, the desire for vengeance, or leaking out feelings of shame, guilt, or inadequacy. The ego-mind is itself captured by a censoring agency and programmed by unconscious phantasies that serve as templates in which experience is interpreted. Other possibilities are locked out. The ego-mind holds consciousness trapped in the box of its preconceptions.When one first attempts to meditate, the ego-mind either will not desist from constant chatter, or else it will put one to sleep. It will try its best to convince one that meditation is boring, a hopeless waste of time. It may create diversions like itches, coughs, muscular discomfort, or distraction by outside noises. The most banal ideas will come into the mind, anything to take one away from the present moment. Meditation is for most people a difficult struggle, at least in the beginning stages.A number of methods have been developed over the centuries to help calm and center the mind to prepare it for deep meditation. This is the real importance of doing asanas, for example. These hatha yoga exercises can slow down the metabolism and de-stress the body, to create an altered state of consciousness in which one can enter into transcendent levels more easily. But simply taking a few minutes at the start of a sitting meditation session to breathe deeply and relax the muscles will accomplish much the same result. Eventually, a simple affirmation that one’s body is relaxing will do the trick.Breathing exercises, called pranayamas, can also be useful. The functioning of the mind is linked to the rhythm of respiration. By slowing down the breathing, the mind can be slowed down as well. But again, all this can be accomplished through simply centering the attention in the awareness that precedes the I-thought. Remaining as the silent witness of the body/mind will slow down the breathing and metabolism naturally and effortlessly.Meditative music can also be used. Soft, slow, graceful music can soothe the mind and entrain the attention into a light state of trance. But soon one loses focus on the outer music, no matter how beautiful it may be, and enters into the realm of inner silence and beatitude, where time seems to stop. Once this realm has been touched, and the Presence of God has been felt, then one can simply remember this exalted state in order to return to it in future meditations.Guided meditation can also be helpful in the beginning, following the voice of a guide into gradually more profound inner states. Eventually, of course, one wants to be independent of outside assistance. In the interim, prayer is a useful way of focusing, bringing one’s attention and intention together on the presence of God within. Mantras, or the repetition of sacred words that point to one’s identity with the Supreme Self, can also be used. For those who do not have a religious attitude in the beginning, counting breaths can be an effective technique. Ultimately, it is the repeated application of will, through any means, impelled by the purpose of making the mind obey the higher intelligence, that brings consciousness into a stable peaceful silence. Now meditation can really begin. If there is an authentic attitude of devotion, the process will of course be accelerated.The most direct ways of entering into deeper states of presence in meditation are known as Self-inquiry and Self-affirmation.Self-inquiry consists of asking (in thought, at first, but in advanced stages without verbal thought) the question “who am I?” and then silently apperceiving the answer. This method was taught by the great modern sage Ramana Maharshi. The question “who am I” is not asked in order to elicit a discourse on one’s identity. It is not intended to evoke images of oneself as an entity in the world. Rather, the question is asked in order to bring one into a state of complete formless subjectivity. The question could even be phrased “what is the I?” to more clearly establish the non-personal basis of I-ness. Or, What does it mean to be an “I”? This is of course a profound philosophical question. But it is not meant to stimulate philosophical conceptualizations. Rather, the question is asked to oneself in thought precisely to bring one’s attention to the inner presence that precedes philosophical speculation. The inner presence of I transcends language and identity. The real I is indescribable. To know the I, I can only be the I.The inner inquiry is therefore intended to bring conscious awareness back to its source in the primal wordless and formless Presence. During meditation, whenever the mind goes off on some tangent, the observing intelligence should stop that wandering tendency by asking “whose thoughts are these?” and recognizing that they must belong to the I. Then, attention can return to the question “who am I,” and thence to the state of silent Presence. By consistently bringing back the mind from its wanderings, it will eventually learn not to wander, but like a trained dog, to heel and to obey the real I. Gradually there will be less and less need to ask the questions, and more time can be spent in silent Presence. Eventually, the imaginary I of the ego, as well as the​ ​conceptual I that monitors it, will disappear altogether, and the boundless, luminous, blissful emptiness of the infinite Self will be constantly, timelessly, here and now.The method of Self-affirmation can achieve the same end. Instead of asking a question, however, which can stimulate in intellectual personalities a flow of ideas, one simply affirms the highest understanding at the outset. Thus, when one sits to meditate, one simply thinks an affirmation such as “I am the Supreme Reality.” Or “I am the One Self.” Or such variations as “I am He,” or “I am That.” Or “God and I are one.” Or simply “I am silent Presence.” Or even more simply: “I AM.” Then one stops the thought process and enters fully into the state of pure awareness. If the mind starts pulling one away from the silence, simply re-affirm the original affirmation and return to pure Divine Presence.If one is more comfortable with a dualist paradigm of relationship to the Supreme Being, then that can also be affirmed with a heartfelt statement such as “I belong to You alone, oh God,” or “I melt in the oneness of love with You.”One can also choose a particular divine attribute to focus on, such as “I am the Self of pure Love.” Or: “I am the Blissful Self.” Or: “I am the Peaceful Self.”The affirmations are not an end in themselves, but an entry-point for merging into the Silence that transcends identity. The only danger in using these methods is that the ego will later misappropriate to itself the qualities or status of the Supreme Self. One must always keep in mind that the ego is a fiction. The Self is not the bodily entity with which the ego identifies, but the transpersonal awareness that is one with all that is. The Self is all and yet also absolute nothingness.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 20:12:52	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.341153	2025-10-28 15:31:24.341153	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

In Christianity, it is called contemplative prayer. It is now used in secular contexts as well by people simply seeking inner peace and relief from stress. Science has proven its effectiveness.Meditation is the art of developing the full potentials of our consciousness. The fundamental principle is to slow down, and eventually halt, the flow of thoughts in the mind. The more silent and still is the inner space of our consciousness, the more serene, happy, and empowered we will feel.This taming of the mind, which for most people is wild and uncontrollable, results in an extraordinary level of self-mastery. Once the mental focus has been trained to respond to our will, we can turn our attention into a laser beam of pure concentration, and achieve much higher levels of skill and effectiveness in any activity we do.We can read faster and retain more information. We can improve our performance in every field, from business to sports to music to creative writing to critical thinking. This is because a quiet mind is more receptive to inspiration and innovative ideas.A meditative mind is more flexible, clear, and unbiased, thus more capable of making accurate decisions and changing directions when called for. A calm mind tends to be more open and loving, more able to listen deeply to others, and less egocentric.In a meditative state, one is more likely to heal quickly from any illnesses, since the immune system is strengthened by the relaxed, even flow of life energy through the organism. This vital power in Yoga is called prana. In Chinese, the word is chi. Increasing the flow of chi is the basis of traditional Chinese medicine and all the Eastern martial arts. An advanced meditator can even direct the flow of spiritual energy to others to augment their healing and sense of wellbeing.Meditation is used by spiritually-oriented seekers to attain what has variously been called Self-realization, God-realization, enlightenment, Buddha Mind, Emptiness, the Tao, or by endless other such exalted terms.This level of meditation is reached when the mind has learned to abide constantly in inner silence in the heart, or the core of our Being. It brings about transcendence of the ego. With that come wisdom, courage, universal love, and a lasting sense of sublime oneness with Ultimate Reality.Many advanced meditators also attest that this highest level of contemplation results in paranormal capacities, including telepathy, accurate premonitions of future events—sometimes called prophecy—and astral travel, or the ability of consciousness to journey safely out of the body to distant locations and higher dimensions. Some say it also enables subtle perception of angels, divine radiance, and other kinds of visions well known to mystics.To get started meditating, there are many easy techniques for beginners. One way, used in Zen monasteries and other such centers of meditation, involves the counting of breaths.One should begin by finding a quiet space where one will not be interrupted and sit comfortably—no difficult Yoga poses are necessary—with the back straight (not hunched over or with the torso twisted), take a few initial deep breaths to release any excess tension, and close one’s eyes to tune out visual distractions. Calming music can be playing in the background, if you wish.Then, begin to count each in-breath and out-breath. As you breathe in, think “one.” Then, as you breathe out, think “two.” Count up to ten and then start again at “one.” That is all. Keep this up for as many rounds as you wish. You will soon notice that your breathing becomes slower and more regular, and with that your metabolism will slow down, the body will spontaneously relax, and there will be a lovely feeling of peacefulness and refreshment.If you were to hook up your head with electrodes, as is often done in laboratory tests of meditation, you would discover that your brainwaves gradually shift from beta to alpha waves, and then, if you continue long enough, into even deeper theta and delta states. These shifts have been shown to produce many positive, lasting effects on our health and personality development into more integrated wholeness.Another popular method, for non-religious meditators, is to simply repeat a syllable or word that represents calming and relaxation to you, or even one that is meaningless, without the counting of breaths. This will have the same effects as the first technique. Of course, religious people will prefer to repeat a Name of God, a short prayer, or a mantra that has deep meaning to them and brings a sense of greater closeness with God or with whatever we conceive of as our Supreme Beingness.There are also techniques that involve keeping the eyes open, including staring at a candle flame, a mandala, a beautiful work of visual art, or a religious icon.Advanced meditators often prefer a method called Self-enquiry. In this approach, you simply ask yourself the question, “Who am I?” Then, rather than answering the question with words, ideas or images, you search within for the center of your Being—beyond all superficial levels of identity, such as your profession or religion or gender orientation or age—and let your attention focus ever more deeply in your innermost sense of Selfhood.This can lead to what feels like a floating, timeless state of bodiless, eternal presence, an infinite expanse of luminous and joyous energy, a sense of liberation from all worries and of profound goodness, security, and confidence that all is perfect. You will know that you are supported in your existence and empowered to live in happiness—in short, what in religious terms, would be called a state of grace.One popular aspect of meditation that attracts newcomers is what has come to be called mindfulness (or vipassana, a Theravada Buddhist term). This is the process of noticing all that arises in consciousness, without reacting to it, without judging it, without identifying with it, and—most importantly—without allowing any stream of thoughts connected with it to divert one from silent presence.This would include reacting to every itch and kink in the body, as well as to thoughts tinged with some emotion, or some extraneous task one must perform later that day, or other ideas, images, and memories that interfere with the steadiness of attention. By not reacting, all such arisings will soon disappear and inner peace will be re-established. It is important not to attack oneself for losing one’s center, as that will start a vicious cycle of negative thinking. Simply wait patiently and witness all that appears and the mind will free itself from its habitual self-deceptions.People considering taking up the practice of meditation often ask if it is better to sit home alone to do it, or more effective in a group setting. The answer is that a group that is led by an advanced meditator (and the more advanced the better, to be able to deal appropriately with spiritual crises that can indeed come up in this practice) and that offers a philosophy congenial to one’s own, and not demanding of blind belief in some creed, will accelerate one’s progress, for several reasons.One is that, as just indicated, once engaged seriously in this practice, many questions will arise because of various strange mental and physical phenomena that can arise in the course of what amounts to a stirring up of the unconscious levels of the psyche through one’s sustained concentration. For the most part, this is a hygienic release of repressed Shadow material from childhood (to use Carl Jung’s term), which in religious terminology would be called the purification of the soul.It is because of the fact that our subjectivity is split into conscious, repressed, and superconscious sectors that there is both the desire to meditate—to gain true wholeness and self-understanding and mastery—and there is the inevitable arising of obstacles and moments of critical encounter with forbidden and unbearable truths. This is why it is imperative to have an ethical, highly experienced, and knowledgeable teacher if one wants to pursue this avenue of growth beyond superficial levels. It is not all hearts and flowers, but also dealing with thorns and dark nights of the soul.To gain skill in this inner work of self-purification, other meditative approaches will eventually be required in addition to mere mindfulness. These include the capacity for analytic meditation and gyana yoga. The analytic skill covers the same ground as psychoanalysis—that of understanding repressed desires, fears, confusions, guilt feelings, and inhibitions—but does so from a simpler, more real and more spiritual paradigm of our true nature and our power to let go of the past.This kind of ethical self-knowledge is necessary to claim the authentic self-mastery and authority over the contents of one’s own mind to be able to deconstruct any disempowering or self-sabotaging thoughts that come from the lower unconscious sectors of our psyche (which is a lot more vast and multidimensional than most of us trained in a rational, scientific paradigm imagine).On the other hand, the gyana yoga—based on accurate knowledge of the superconscious levels of our Being, is useful in navigating the advanced stages of meditation that open up to the higher Mind—enabling us to understand and make use of the visions and insights and sublime feelings that will be received in deep Samadhi (the very advanced absorption in the innermost core of consciousness that produces the ecstatic energies and wisdom that many seekers yearn for).Another reason to choose to meditate in a group or esoteric school setting with an adept teacher (a setting that is known in Yoga as a satsang—a gathering of those seeking the inmost Truth of our Being) is that during meditation people emanate an energy field, and a group energy field is more powerful than an individual one. So just by sitting in a positive and peaceful energy field created by a number of meditators together in a room can set up a resonance effect in one’s own inner space (since all our minds are in quantum entanglement, as science has discovered) and boost one’s own vibrational energy levels enormously, to get one past the breakers of initial resistance, until one is swimming in the deep cool waters of a sea of serenity.There are many places one can go to study and practice meditation (and of course one should make a careful and informed choice before making a commitment, since there are many charlatans and cult groups that have ulterior motives), and many books written on the subject. But the main thing is just to start doing it, and make it a regular habit—even if for only a half-hour a day. Make sure you do not go to sleep during your practice or waste your time chattering to yourself, but stay on course with your chosen technique. Soon, almost without recognizing the change, your life will take a turn for the better.People will tell you that you look younger and more energized. Some will ask if you just came back from a vacation. Others will notice a glow of wellbeing in your aura. Old unwanted habits will fall away by themselves, anxieties will disappear, and a positive attitude of being successful and prosperous will stay constant and actually bring new opportunities and successes into your life.In the challenging and stressful times we are now living in, the ability to meditate is an essential tool in helping us get the most out of life. It will keep us calm and cool when under pressure, it will give us the fearlessness to face down intimidation, and the discernment not to be taken in by the false promises or seductions of others or our own wishful projections.Skill in meditation will, in short, make us wiser, without having to go through being sadder first. It will make us more realistic, with more acute “street smarts”—but we will also recognize that we live in an unlimited reality with such extraordinary potentials that those ignorant of the insights and powers gained in meditation will foolishly call them mere fantasies. Meditation is a direct path to levels of individuation and Self-discovery undreamt of by most people, and unfortunately still repressed by most of our society.Soon, if you discipline yourself from the beginning to practice even when you would rather watch TV or surf the internet, meditation will have become second nature and you will find yourself naturally meditating whenever you have a short break in the day, and that even these little dips into inner peace enrich your life more than you can express in words.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 20:12:16	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.343171	2025-10-28 15:31:24.343171	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

In other words, this simple line of reasoning brings the mind to the very edge of the ego illusion, enabling an easy recognition of the state beyond thought that is the Presence of God. This is the most direct path to Liberation.	video	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/Wed-Jun-18-Vigyani-Pragyani-Exclusive-250614_DF_GM-Intro-Discussion-1.png	2120	2025-06-18 15:20:01	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.688669	2025-11-04 12:13:47.297227	["ea548b82c3b1655b2607a6139977589f"]	[]	["nwQi8nLbqcU"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The crown of creation has lost its credibility.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	We are at the cusp between an age that is dying and a new one that is being born. In the increasingly critical fermentation of a rotting economy mulching with a devastated ecology, human mastery has become a joke. The crown of creation has lost its credibility.There are those who still desperately dive into ditches of denial, while others even more desperately attempt to keep the chaos under control. But those who are honest confess the hopelessness, the impotence, even the impossibility of it all. And yet all the while, revolutionary shifts are occurring under the malfunctioning radar screen. We are witnessing the rise of new social forms and new spiritual capacities.One of these is the appearance of a viral form of communal organization that could be called the paradoxshram. It is somewhat like the ancient Indian ideal of the yogic ashram; but it includes and accepts the fact that no one has the power any more to keep vows, to sustain object constancy and faithfulness in relation to any sort of being, let alone the Supreme Being. The paradoxshram is a refuge for failed monks who are also failed denizens of the polymorphously perverse world of postmodernity.A paradoxshram is a hermitage for outcasts, misfits, eccentric millionaires, and those who have grown beyond the limits of neurotic normality and seek the infinite divine madness that alone can satisfy the urge for the ultimate adventure. These adventure capitalists turn their pathologies into prophets, making use of the principle of paradox that turns every quiddity upside down and inside out into a new quid pro quo vadis that is anything but faddish. This is alchemy on steroids, morphing the lead of the ego into the gold of pure Spirit, making buddhas out of boohoos, bobos, and the last authentic bohemians.Only in a paradoxshram can melodrama be transformed into mellow dharma without losing a stride. Only in such a setting can those who are structurally unable to make a commitment realize they have found a home, a community that is committed to them even if they do not reciprocate. And what is realized by those who enter fully into the paradox of their own hateful lack of being? Every structure of the mind is only a dream, easily melted down without a meltdown, when there is nothing external to resist. No matter how locked down is one’s heart, the iron liquefies when the heat of love produced by the friction of wisdom and compassion becomes sufficiently intense.The joy of frustration, hate, and illness is unmasked as the timeless bliss of peace, unity and healing. The unmasking of course brings renewed resistance, renewed suffering, and then that too is revealed as the ecstasy of love. In the ongoing moebius strip show of purity porn, love is stillborn, yet still borne. The very death that is the ground and destiny of life spectrally remains as the spectrum of consciousness that contains its antithetic medicine of eternal life.The wonder of the Goddess is that she can appear in any and every form—from the whore of Babylon to Kali the mad mass murderess to the ugly beggar on the street to the queen of heaven—without having a hair on her lovely head be disturbed. Her perfection transcends all its permutations and is unconcealed through her very shape-shifting hiddenness and her ability to turn the light into darkness, good into evil, and finally reveal every evil as a manifestation of the supreme good.The Goddess is liberated in a paradoxshram. The ego is liberated to reveal itself as the Atman. Matter admits it has always only been pure spirit. Time confesses its true nature as eternity. Enmity concedes it has always been deep amity. All the pairs of opposites marry in a ceremony of innocence that in no sense can be construed as such.The world is a patchwork of such vast conspiracies that not even the most psychotic conspiracy theorist could imagine. Every conspiracy is unwittingly part of a larger one, which is a cell in a yet larger and more devious plot that no one without a need to know could ever glimpse—until the airplanes hit the towers.And although greed for money may be the root of all evil, evil is the real root of good, and good is the root of all wealth. Ultimately, the only sensible investment of one’s money is into the replenishing of the original seed of consciousness that sprouts into all these interwoven roots that create new routes to freedom and empowerment, save one’s soul, give meaning and hope to one’s existence, produce a new vision, a new culture, the possibility of a new world, one that can turn poison into fertilizer and death into life. Such a world can only germinate in a paradoxshram.Our world is only our mind, but once the mind has released itself from all limits, infinite intelligence is available to solve even the most recalcitrant and intractable problems, like that of nuclear radiation, climate change, and all the other plagues now descending like a dark cloud of locusts on a world gone mad. We are mad because we are insufficiently mad, and mad in the wrong ways. But even that wrong-headed insanity contains the seeds of salvation, if they can only be cultivated with care and compassion, acumen and understanding. Such uncanny canniness can only emerge in the pure imperfection of the ambience of a paradoxshram.Only a mad philanthropist would fund such a new social order, such a strange expression of divine communalism; only the most brilliant could recognize the absolute necessity and centrality of such supreme peripherality as supporting the emergence of a motley crew of screwball yogis who just might discover the secret of world renewal and attain the power to pull it off. But this much is clear: sane atheists cannot do it; conventional religious people can only pray for it; conventional psychotics cannot go beyond drool, delusions, and dreams. Only those whose madness has fully integrated with the ultimate vision of the Absolute can download the logic of this holographic hell realm and reload it as an eidolon of celestial joy.Within you right now is a hidden paradoxshramite, a would-be Buddha seeking a sangha that can sing your cynicism into sheer delight. If you look hard enough, without and within, the seeking itself will overcome all sense of sin, and although your ego will go into a spin, the good sense of your survival instinct already intuits that only such a tribe of treasonous tribulationists can be true to the deepest calling of this historic moment, rather than getting lost in the trivia of passing apocalyptic phenomena. Those who can trump the triumphant but temporary elite of banksters and gangsters can only be the ultimate pranksters, the crazy wisdom teachers running loose on your nearest paradoxshram preparing to drop the paramatman bomb of bliss on an unsuspecting world.Foreboding indeed is the rise of the Paradoxshram.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nAshram LifeParadox	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 19:38:16	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.349803	2025-10-28 15:31:24.349803	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Simply “injoy!” Injoy means that your very nature, your essence, is joy. Joy is always forever within. You ARE injoy.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	Yes, this may be the simplest of all possible ways to attain liberation in life. There is absolutely nothing to do. Simply “injoy!” Injoy means that your very nature, your essence, is joy. Joy is always forever within. You ARE injoy.Injoy is an unusual word. It is at the same time noun and verb and adjective. Injoy is completely different from “enjoy.” “Enjoy” is an action of someone, or a command, it requires a doing, it is a temporary situational experience, one that can be lost, and therefore can be longed for, which creates pain and suffering. In fact, all our pain and suffering comes from a longing for a lost enjoyment (kept distant by false beliefs regarding oneself and reality). But injoy is our very Being. Injoy cannot be lost. We are always injoy.So the simplest path is to stop seeking to ENjoy, and simply INjoy. This does not require any particular kind of meditation. One need not sit cross-legged, nor chant some mantra, nor even think about God. In fact, you will find God injoy, without even looking. If there is looking, or seeking of any kind, then one is not injoy. When injoy, then all things come of themselves. Flowers and birdsong and dancing and delicious sensations of every sort flourish injoy. Life itself is injoy. Injoy is the essence of all things. Even the mind in the most rarified process of abstraction performs its representational acrobatics injoy. In fact, you may discover that even when reading, a text will actually read itself to you injoy. All that is real is injoy. Even pain is injoy.What could be simpler? Instead of suffering over the lack of some thing you want to enjoy, choose to realize your true nature as injoy!The Self or the Truth or the God or the Emptiness or the Liberation that we seek on our spiritual path we truly already are. There is thus nothing left to do, but celebrate: Injoy!\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nDevotion	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 19:33:18	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.354502	2025-10-28 15:31:24.354502	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But the world can also be translated into the language of number. In the last ten centuries, human consciousness has become increasingly mathematized. Capitalism is all about quantity: how much is something worth, how many are available, what will be the amount of return on my investment, how large will be my profits in the coming year, etc. Mathematics is the main instrument of social control, military power, and economic policy. Without higher mathematics, there could be no weapons of mass destruction, no electric grid, no digital surveillance, no nanotechnology for biowarfare, no geoengineering, and no agents operating with artificial intelligence. The Word creates, Number destroys. Mathematics has no meaning, no heart, no mercy. We have all become mere numbers in the social order, dehumanized and devalued as useless eaters. But there is a third language of God: the language of Silence. Word creates, Number kills, but Silence saves. To save our souls, let us learn to commune with God in Silence.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/3Fri-Nov-1_Members-Teaching241019_RSR_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	4417	2024-11-01 12:25:29	qa	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:23.986649	2025-11-04 11:16:01.727047	["c95723ff786bc203f074c182cbbbc352"]	["2gx3b-1716c9d-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

ac3ec42e-2117-4cdc-93fe-2799d761cb52	leave-inferno-ego	Leave the Inferno of the Ego Mind	The chattering ego mind functions as a veil to separate our consciousness from the realization of the Whole. Within the ego, the mindfield is further fragmented into many illusory parts, each with a different drive and orientation toward the Other. Some parts are helpful and compassionate, others may be dark and demonic. Still others may be sad, frightened, anxious, ashamed, confused, and feel powerless. This turns the ego into a conflicted hell realm. There is a path of purification that leads quickly through Purgatorio to the superconscious Paradiso of the Supreme Self. If you are willing to leave your attachments behind, your inner wisdom will guide you to freedom.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/01/3Fri-Jan-12-Members-Teaching-231119_Morning-GM-Teaching.png	1196	2024-01-12 12:11:25	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.035943	2025-11-04 11:17:17.796131	["b433fb725b88bd21e2f6c1117cb17bac"]	["v6bu6-152ee0f-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Consciousness and its world both undergo the passage into annihilation. But then, as the chaos converts into pure potentiality, it morphs into a new and perfect order. Thus, the world dies and is reborn. Worldhood itself is without beginning or end. Time is not other than eternity.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/4-Fri-Dec-29-Members-Teaching-231126_Morning-GM-Teaching.png	1871	2023-12-29 11:54:49	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.037141	2025-11-04 11:17:20.321561	["70d1d2c9fc5f4e5c7e38313de2d74c99"]	["mf8yf-152edb2-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
8fa19098-d01b-40c0-8760-9c63e9e5a9ae	aghori-best-strategy	The Aghori Option May Be Your Best Strategy	Today, many people are functioning as hungry ghosts. And many are paralyzed spiritually by feelings of disgust and shame about their self-images, histories, and modes of self-presentation. In this context, Shunyamurti retells a story originally told by Acharya Sthaneshwar Timalsina about his meeting with an Aghori guru—and explores the implications of the extreme lifestyles and practices of those pariah yogis with amazing powers. Through this analysis, we learn how to raise our consciousness to new symbolic heights and then pass beyond the mind to the Supreme Real. This enables the liberated Self to emerge.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/4-Fri-Nov-10-MEMBERS-231024_RSR_Evening-GM-Teaching-QA.png	4102	2023-11-10 12:16:55	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.042803	2025-11-04 11:17:28.891868	["85880856b7f0b4cc65e349dfb0d4bbae"]	["w3fn4-14e794c-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is possible to live a divine life–if one is willing to trade the ego-mind for the mind of God, and see the supreme perfection of all, not with the eye of the ego, or even with the eye of the soul, but with the single eye of Shiva, which keeps the consciousness constantly divinized in this confluence age that we are being called to redream a divine world.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/01/4-221219_Morning_members_How-to-Divinize-Your-Life.png	1161	2023-01-27 12:42:09	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.076938	2025-11-04 11:59:00.752515	["fdb59ffad6c6af56cea7d5398860fc60"]	["7qmtu-1372b81-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Many have lost all they once gave thanks for in this time of tyranny and lost ideals. What is required now is to act in such a way that future generations will be thankful for what we have done, the sacrifice we have made, to ensure the restoration of what is truly great and worthy in the human spirit. Let us transform this obsolete holiday into a Re-Constitution Day—we must re-constitute our nature from that of sheep into lionhearted spiritual warriors. By making the ultimate sacrifice of the ego, recovering our nature as souls, we shall be empowered to initiate the renewal of our world to its original pristine state of beauty, secured by divine love, and sustained by noble goodness. Our heroic action now will found the culture of the future, and we can feel their gratitude even as we raise our consciousness to the infinite Self in this very moment. All thanks be to God.	videoandaudio	gyani	0	\N	\N	\N	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/11/Members-Regular.png	4670	2022-11-24 14:36:51	video_teaching	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.084171	2025-11-04 12:10:43.069975	["b1983d8385636b3bbf39d5c98bb24ed1"]	["vtmd6-1321671-pb"]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Letting go of belief in any and all self-images, self-concepts, identifications with the body or with the mind, or even with the heart, is the key to real validation and valid realization.

It is rather a transformational Event. It is a moment of entering nonordinary reality, of peering into the dimension of Truth beyond the pathos, pretenses, preconceptions, prostitutions, prozac, and privations of egoic existence.Even if one is not Christian, the symbolic significance of the sacred moment of the birth of Christ pertains to us all as a reference to a milestone in our own spiritual development. Christmas symbolizes the moment you let all the masks fall away, including the ones that you yourself believed in, the moment you accept the emptiness of the ego and permit yourself to emerge into life as who you really are. Christmas is the moment when all that is human within you surrenders to the divine within you. Instead of looking for a savior to come and set you free, you become what you were looking for.To fulfill that mandate, Christmas must be a time of deep meditation, of burrowing within until the Self is realized, then allowing the Real Self to emerge completely from the labyrinth of unconsciousness, to be fully and truly born into this world. This is the only birth of Christ that counts—when Christ is born within you, not simply a celebration of that long ago time when Self Realization was born within someone else in the Middle East.We are each also in the position of Mary, since each of us must surrender to Absolute Spirit, to be impregnated with divine light, and to carry that union of the human and the divine until both elements are fully integrated and ready to begin the labor of miraculous birth and individuation. In this season of transformation, let us each also humbly accept that we may sometimes find ourselves in the position of Joseph, and to support others who may have grown beyond us, and though we cannot be directly involved in the miracles that are occurring to them, let us not be infected with envy, but protect and honor the divine spark as its halo becomes visible in those we love, even if their transformation brings about a separation and alteration of our relationship. Let us each be the midwife of our own divine birth, and assist in those of others, so that the Cosmic Christ may be born not only in oneself but in every one.What does it mean to allow Christ to be born within me? A time comes in the life of each of us when we outgrow our ego identity. None of the old desires does it for me any more. Something in me recognizes that reality is different from any of the stories about it that I told myself, or that were told to me by my family, society, or even my religion. Outgrowing those stories, and the desires and inhibitions that were kept alive by those stories, leads one to a new kind of aloneness. One can no longer fit in with the crowd as before. Thus, “there is no room at the inn” when this new birth occurs. One must accept one’s differentness, one’s uniqueness, even though that may require being born in a manger.Of course, the new identity cannot be born until the old one dies. So one must put to rest the egoic indulgence in narcissism, the game of anger and blame, or co-dependent people-pleasing, or the many ways of camouflage, evasion, and denial. One must be prepared to be fully present and transparent—not just for oneself, but for all those who are accompanying one in one’s life. There is a surrender involved, not just to Spirit, but to life, a commitment to responsibility to the dharma of one’s chosen role in the grand worldly illusion.How, then, to approach a spiritual Christmas? First, consider offering yourself some gifts: Can you look back upon the year and feel satisfied that you met life’s challenges this year, that you grew in wisdom and emotional maturity, that you let go of some of the old limitations, that you at least made progress in shedding the old skin, that you discovered new horizons? Allow yourself to accept even what you think of as failings, by learning the lessons those experiences were meant to teach. Give up indulging in guilt, shame, and other forms of self-torment. Before you can align what you want with what you desire, so that you may fulfill your highest goals, you must heal the split between who you wish you were and who you are afraid you are. To do that, you must discover who you really are.And give some gifts to your Self for the future. Make some powerful affirmations: I accept my Self. I am at peace with my Self. I am a being of love, of joy, of infinite patience and understanding. I will face all the uncertainties of existence with calmness and fortitude. I live from the Heart of Spirit, from the space of inner silence and divine love.Then look even deeper within and ask: Have I come to experience the permanent immanent transcendence of the Real Self? Can I afford to give myself that gift as well?Something in me wants to be born that is indescribable, unspeakable, incomprehensible. I am a wordless presence that is beyond all desire—and all fear. I am filled with wonder. I am the awareness that contains all, the nothingness and the whole, creator and creation. I am one with the Being of God. It is a sacred moment of entering into eternal silence—a silent night, a holy night of the soul. And what follows is a new birth of joy in the world. May this year be for you the Real Christmas, the eternal Christmas that the religious holiday only symbolizes. Let us go beyond symbols now. The world is waiting for You to be born.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nHoly Days	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 19:24:19	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.356695	2025-10-28 15:31:24.356695	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Exploding as the cosmic thrill of Being, we are called to the Shining Power of our divine and Buddhic essence, hyper-saturated with Shakti, Love, and Bliss.The Sun Door opens, its golden aperture the absence of mind, the power of silence.  Eternal Stillness.  Holding the perfect note of purest presence, passing through the gates of the Deep, of Groundless Emptiness, alone, all One, you know again, and always already remember that all existence in this labyrinthine matrix leads to this mythical unfoldment, the appearance of the final portal, the sacrificial melt-through, mind dissolving into the serene and silent flow of unutterable sweetness, to return and merge once more into the ocean of supreme bliss that you have always been and could not ever not be. Together, yet alone, in communion of utmost holiness, the One God in the sacred form of Community, flowing lava-like into and out of the depths of the Unknowable Self, the Darkness that is the Source of the one and only Light.You are Infinity O golden portal, Star Gate, Monolith of Emptiness, priceless mirror in which alone can be seen the Face of God.Phenomenology of Brahman, Physiognomy of Shiva, Merciful Love of Allah, Power of Yahvah, come and be anointed as Messiah, Christ, Avatar of Purity: Brahmachari.​\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nRelationships	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 19:17:52	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.360888	2025-10-28 15:31:24.360888	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Many of you may not realize that you are experiencing constraction, because it is often a state that appears as a compaction, rather than being open to introspection. But as the term indicates, it represents a multi-leveled consciousness that seemingly consists, at first glance, only of the elements of constriction and distraction. This produces an emotional reaction of contraction and restriction, leading to constraint and frustration.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	An advanced student of Sat Yoga recently invented a new and subtle concept of great universal relevance, and I feel the need to share this with y’all.It is the concept of constraction. Many of you may not realize that you are experiencing constraction, because it is often a state that appears as a compaction, rather than being open to introspection. But as the term indicates, it represents a multi-leveled consciousness that seemingly consists, at first glance, only of the elements of constriction and distraction. This produces an emotional reaction of contraction and restriction, leading to constraint and frustration.But on more profound meditation, it reveals itself to be a construction, cleverly designed as an attraction, a form of consternation to which one can only respond with concern, pity, and compassion. Is it constructive or reductive to be constractive? It is certainly one way to be proactive—but it can easily become addictive.Of course, the one who is constracted will then go through a retraction, after experiencing her refraction through the gaze of another’s redaction. The point is that the constraction gives secret satisfaction, which increases the joy of relaxation through its own self-destruction by inflating its deflation into a new and opposite creation.Every movement and moment in this dance of self-extraction, groundlessly zooming from tears of joy to sobs of frustration to the looming laughter of insightful incitation to join in co-creation or determined deconstruction, are all part of the endless bliss of divine interaction.And thus, through the arcane constraction process, what is ultimately produced is the legendary nectar of immortality, become a reality through the churning of its opposing polarities. We steal from ourselves to induce further charities, which result in clarities that transcend all banality and even mortality.Every part of the dance is beautiful, especially that which is most ugly, revealing the disparity between the outer and the deep interiority, followed by the return to our true priorities through the acceptance of both our practiced inferiority and our infracted superiorities.Through the dance of constraction we break out of the prison of identity and feel what it is to be a non-entity as part of what we are meant to be. The shape-shifting drivenness to reach painful and futile givenness only to re-emerge from the abyss of groundless giddiness with a smile of acrobatic virtuosity and a flawless self-image, almost pomposity, shows the power of the Self to overcome Itself in the divine redemption of self-enslavement to freedom by leaping forward through infinite regress.Any abreaction to constraction can only lead to yet another fatal self-detraction. How to gain traction to leave behind this fraction of our total capacity for action?This will require exaction, abstraction, and neutralizing counteraction to the chronic impaction. It is all a wondrous stupefaction.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming Obstacles	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 18:06:24	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.36485	2025-10-28 15:31:24.36485	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
c4c5e105-f8b6-4687-ad0f-1ac4207ebc7d	five-mystical-ecstatic-openings-dead-mind-treatment	Five Mystical Ecstatic Openings	The great and supremely liberated sage Sri Ramana Maharshi taught that “tranquility is not experienced except by inner harmony, and inner harmony will only exist for those who have a dead mind.” He adds: “Those whose minds have dived deep and died in that fullness of pure consciousness and supreme grace will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary appearance within it.”	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	Five Mystical Ecstatic Openings: Dead Mind Treatment (5-MEO-DMT),The great sage Sri Ramana Maharshi taught that “tranquility is not experienced except by inner harmony, and inner harmony will only exist for those who have a dead mind.” He adds: “Those whose minds have dived deep and died in that fullness of pure consciousness and supreme grace will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary appearance within it.”Sat Yoga follows Sri Ramana’s understanding, and its rigorous practice brings about the death of the ego through five mystical ecstatic openings. These are: the sensuous opening, the emotional opening, the cognitive opening, the intuitive opening, and the transcendental opening.The Sat Yoga Ashram, on the holy red mountain of New Arunachala, amid the waveform hills of southern Costa Rica, is the perfect location for opening to the timeless spell of the sensuous realm. Surrounded by the astonishing richness of wild nature, its myriad life forms, mystic cloud forests, the sacred rushing river Ganga and her sparkling cascades, waterfalls and bathing pools; the refreshing clean mountain air; the awesome tall trees decked with singing avians; the sudden appearance on a trail of berry bushes bursting with ripe delicious fruits; the elegant ashram gardens with their labyrinthine lanes; the long giri pradakshina loop, with carefully placed benches for meditating on panoramic vistas; the long white ribbons of distant water leaping off majestic cliffs into the abyss; while, at one’s feet, appear the serious works of leaf-cutter ants and honey bees, the fluttering butterflies, the nectar sips and zips of hummingbirds; and in the middle distance, the awesome flight of the great white hawk; and the endless caravan of colors produced by miraculous swoopings of toucans, parrots, swifts, and too many other species of birds to count; and above all, the uncannily monstrous roars of the howler monkeys in a family feud.Every day at Arunachala brings new delights in the sensuous realm, from each redemptive sunrise and its sharpening brightness gleaming on the deep green hills; the dervish dialogues of darting birds and their screeching kirtan of call and response; and of course the om-ing mantras of meandering cows on far off slopes; then cut to the wispy oncoming fingers of fog, conspiring to cut off space and time with full immersion in a whitened cloud of unknowing, illumined like a solid block of pure eternal consciousness.The sensuous opening creates an aptitude for spatience, the capacity for integrated vast boundless spaciousness and infinite serene patience, in which the waiting consciousness can palpate its own presence, its own world-in-being interpenetrating its being-in-the-world.Emotional openings also happen all the time at Arunachala. Sometimes they are impromptu events of sudden joy and laughter at simple synchronicities. Other times they are brought about deliberately, through offbeat exercises in crazy wisdom, or an om-provisational theater class, or the sharing of art work or poetry; or deep feelings may come up in a conversation with a spiritual guide, or in a dream interpretation; or the upwelling of sublime yearning for union with God provoked by chanting or devotional song.Emotional openings appear everywhere, at nearly every moment at Arunachala, like subtle hermits’ caves inscribed in the curvature of the womb-like space of the ashram’s subtle energy field, holding one like the mother goddess sweetly cradles her happy newborn divine child.Emotional openings often lead inward to the deadlocked dungeon of forbidden knowledge, where skeletons can pop suddenly out of mental closets where they had been hidden since the dawn of the family system in which the ego was hatched and handcuffed, blinded by its loyalty to airbrushed memories, caged with cardboard cutout parental figures playing proxy to absent love, abusive interactions, and uncaring inattention. In the safety and spiritual purity of Arunachala, one comes to remember and be able to speak about the unspeakable, to bear and repair the soul’s traumatic rips that had been repressed because of being too unbearable to know.One enters the door of the heart, where anxiety and desire fused long ago into anxire, and where now, through compassionate witnessing, the loving listening that deconstructs, defuses and detoxifies demonic fragments of torn-off consciousness, the blood-red pools of anxire morph into ethereal roses of surreal beauty and staggeringly rapturous fragrance, the irresistible redolence of absolute love of the egoless Self.Cognitive openings large enough to drive a tank through (the armored vehicle of the ego that arrives at Arunachala to find itself immobilized, obsolete, and marooned in empty space, with nothing to shoot at, no bad objects to peg its paranoia on) emerge in every gyana yoga class, where each arrow of ancient wisdom, reconfigured for the postmodern mind, and delivered with an archer’s accuracy, breaks through the heart-mind’s old defenses. So ends the ego’s occupation and oppression of one’s soul.Knowledge becomes the Now Ledge, the point of presence at the edge of illusion, facing the chasm of ultimate cognitive dissidence, contemplating the dizzy dance of indeterminate identity. One feels the updraft of truth from the abyss of Absolute Nothingness into which one must leap in full faith to the only death that yields eternal life.Cognitive openings are offered at every turn of the page of time, as early morning class sparkling with poetic reflections is followed by midday meditation’s straight-shot teachings, and ending in evening’s wisdom of simplicity.From the group’s screening and analysis of current and classic films, from the consuming of the essence of great books, the messages of magi, the meanings of myths, the implications of entanglement of quantum minds, metaphors drip from the delirium of divine insight, from the poetry of a long-forgotten saint—one’s complacency is always being pulled up short and stopped in its tracks, in direct encounter with the Great Beyond within.Intuitive openings may also happen any time, perhaps in a satori while ambling through the sacred forest; or an astounding realization may come while considering a symptom of habitual suffering, suffusing the soma with psyche; or eureka may ring while playing an instrument, composing a melody, or even while washing dishes after lunch. The heart understands what the head can never know, and in the growing silence of the soul at Arunachala, intuition constantly augments its power, refines its clarity and coherence, inspires with its glowing diamond lightning.The transcendental openings are of course the magnum opus of a spiritual retreat, the meditative samadhi-symphonies of silence that sing out with supernal light and transmute terror into deathless bliss. Purified wholistic consciousness, released from biographical and biological identifications, regains its home advantage, the self-luminous magnetism of the Mother Light. Shakti severs the knots that bind the mind to mundane matters and frees one from the ego’s fantasmatic fury in the teacup of tempestuous narcissism. Fractal filigree of fifth-dimensional photisms fill the unfolding horizons of flaming form fields, widening into wormholes woven of uncreated light waves, wafting the weightless point of immaculate brilliance, the speck of Being condensing every cosmos into the infinitesimal Present that packs eternity within its pith. The lost star of cosmic consciousness returns to its galaxy of glory, the central Sun of selfless Selfhood. Silken ecstasies dissolve all sense of solidity or separation.The ego mind, dead on arrival at the celestial abode of the superconscious Self, explodes into nebulae of noetic splendor. The toad is kissed into the prince of paradise. Life in Heaven comes to light on a suddenly new Earth, now emerging from the deep sea of astonishing insight. Unfathomably miraculous events are spontaneously unleashed. The mirage of cause and effect has ceased. Satan is once more in chains, and the holy power of God’s Heart reigns.Through the portal of these five mystical ecstatic openings, the dead mind treatment (let’s call it 5-meo-dmt, for short) has gained its goal: the reunification and redemption of the Whole. The Sat Yogi’s dharma and the shaman’s drum meet and beat as one in the diamond dreamland of inter-dimensional love.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nAshram Life	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 18:03:21	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.368921	2025-10-28 15:31:24.368921	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The next age will appear when Sat Mind emerges and the will to suffering ends.They say it is the end of the calendar of the Maya. Maya means illusion. The illusion of the ego is exhausted. But the moment of its death depends on the surrender of the will to the One Self.When illusion ends, the Real is recognized as Eternal Intelligent Blissful Presence.Now, indeed, the time of the imperative of Self Realization is upon us. To end the illusory world of egoic oppression, the Lotus of the Timeless Real must open. That is the Pure Land of infinite Light—Sat Mind.It would be a mistake to focus on calendar dates to determine the end of the world illusion. It would be an error to be disappointed and become skeptical when the world does not end on some predicted date. The end will not happen in time. The end is simply a metaphor that signifies the pure transcendent eternal consciousness, forever beyond time.When the world ends does not depend on the world, but on the Self. The world ends through surrender of the ego delusion and realization of the Self.Sat Mind, the non-objective egoless Self, appears as the divine play of ecstatic delight. The world illusion dissolves into the Kingdom of Heaven. The illusion of time dissolves into eternity. All things are made new. Being is effortless, spontaneous, and free. All is Light.There is no world, only awareness. All is consciousness. When consciousness is purified of the defilement of the ego delusion, the Pure Mind, Sat Mind, appears in the form of Sat Yuga—the long-promised Golden Age. The New World is rising within you now. The One Self does all, is all, creates all, sustains all, dissolves all, and reveals all. The One Self, Allah, Jehovah, the Cosmic Christ, Shiva, is Alone.Realization of the One Self is Sat Yoga.Sat Yoga, realization of the One Self, brings Sat Yuga into being. Nothing else is necessary. This is our Deliverance.Being always in Sat Mind is our only function. This is our Salvation. This is our Service.This is the Tao of Sat Yoga.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nState of the World	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-07-01 09:28:24	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.376329	2025-10-28 15:31:24.376329	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Love arises as a rupture of reality, destabilizing all that had been known. The secret formula understood by the great tantra masters is the mixture of love, desire, self-restraint and recognition (discernment, or viveka, leading to withdrawal of projections). This is the recipe for an atmic bomb. The atman is what makes us tick. The time bomb ticks with the talk of love, the God that is love.God has always only been a word for the explosion of brutally beatific consciousness that annihilates the ego. The trigger for this explosion is love. But the explosion is also ignited by the ineluctable awareness of synchronicity and the unsurpassable intelligence sublating the universe, seeing full-on the inauthenticity of the ego and all its projects, propelling the well-deserved self-shattering of its world through internal schisms and disowned betrayals. But God is also bliss, joy everlasting and overflowing. Is joy, too, a trauma?As any psychotherapist can testify, the ego holds onto its refusal of joy at all costs. It will fight for its irrational justifications for anger and hatred to the death. Because joy spells the death of the ego, and the freedom from its prison, through the bending of the bars of representation that open a space for transcendent Mind, that is terrifying to the consciousness disunited from its Source. For such a weak false consciousness—yet one that shields itself with the defiance that comes from identification with its superego demands—the refusal of the shattering approach of God warrants cutting off all channels of joyous awareness of the Supreme Real.God’s laughter is always echoing from just beyond the event horizon of the ego. The laughter cuts both ways, revealing the ego’s world as a spectral effluence of light projecting through the filters of the unconscious and superconscious imagoes our demonic yet divine dreamfield matrix. The light of God, even when reduced to a single ray by the ego’s negativity, shines its spotlight intensely upon the ego as usurious usurper of the kingdom of the One. Its conscience burns, traumatized by the sweet supernal light. The ego cannot face God and live. Its writhing rejection of Being, Intelligence, and Bliss will lead the ego down the road to hell, to the karmic destination that can be evaded but cannot finally be avoided in its template of time. The Atman will, in the end, obliterate the ego mind, hollowing out the person, leaving only Emptiness. The Shunya Purusha shall arise from the dust of egoic vanity.But what has love got to do with it?Love in the context of the spiritual search-cum-evasion leads to the opening of the heart, and both desire and love arise already entwined with the imaginary, the golden braid of maya. Truthfulness emerges as a constituent of love, and it is this urge to know, part of the upper death drive, that leads always to the unforeseen vaporization of the ego, in much the same way as micro-nuclear explosions vaporized the core of the twin towers. Desire plays the role of the planted charges of nano-thermite, melting the outer casing of the conscious discourse in its orbit around the strange attractor of its primal imago; and recognition acts as a directed energy beam (the eye of Shiva) that dissolves the inner phantasies, the imaginary structure of the ego’s identifications. The grimly gorgeous phallic braid of maya suddenly turns to dust in one’s mouth. It is a dust one has tasted since the dawn of time.The explosive power of love subtends the entire universe, which itself begins as an explosion. Love gives birth, and birth is a rupture, a separation, a death. There is no love without mourning, no morning without the death of the night before. The light destroys the darkness, and love kills oneness as much as it yearns for its return. Love kills an imaginary oneness in order to cling to one that seems more stable, more powerful, more fulfilling, but that illusion is also always already half-crushed in its inception. Love in the matrix of duality, being partial and conditional, is always simultaneously rejection of love. And love that has an object always comes with an objection. The subject of love is forever subjected to its own uncertainty, ambivalence, tormented by its failure to fully open to its own desire.The inherent murder of the mother in the newborn’s cry of life is accompanied forever with the psychic echoes of guilt for one’s existence. The Freudian charade of Oedipus is only a cover-up, a phallic facade for the nakedness of the longing for the womb. Is it not an act of recompense as much as vengeance when two lovers come together? Is not the hole that is being filled always the one within the heart? We are not built to bear the pain of our impossibility, and at some point, when the monstrous knowledge of our failure to BE faces us with the mountain of shame that we had carried on our back as if it were the world, and the last straw drops heavily upon the straw man, Atlas at last collapses, alas, into a pile of hollow straw that is good for nothing but to be immolated on the ever-waiting sacrificial pyre. We were only begat for the burning ghat, God’s gift to turn us into That.What has Love’s Ghat to do with it?Love is always a burning fire. The fire of hate is not different. The fire is our fate. Love strikes like an unseen rocket. Do we not want to know what kind of missile struck the pentagon? But can we get past desire’s disinformation? Our castrated star has been sliced by the vajra that leaves only an empty mirror for our gaze, a mirror that will not reflect us back into the Self. The satanic pentagram of the sensual manifold is forever in flames, and though it turns from good to evil, from bliss to anguish, from exaltation to degradation, our famished filaments can only feed upon the beauty that Baphomet fills with demonic drive, devouring what we adore and leaving it behind as excrement or vomit, defiling our lives with the implosion that the devil falsely blames on God.What’s Love’s God to do with it?The ego makes a mockery of the majesty of love, the mystery of infinite beauty that is no object, but the Self-luminous awareness pervading and permutating into all the kundalini’s kaleidoscopic forms that capture our hearts and hold us captivated until the moment of the killing, the slaughter that we sought in Kali’s conjugal embrace. Love is none other than the counterpart of Death, the sweet foreplay the replay of denied desire for immediate immolation by the eye of Shiva. Love and Death are the twin emanations of God that reunite at the stroke of midnight that stops, and restarts, the cartwheel of the heart-wheel of Cosmic Time.Consciousness is either with God or with the ego. Both are terrorists, the real suicide bombers of Sodom and Gomorrah. The choice is between one death drive and another. The empire of the ego is its own false flag operation. The ego operates secretly behind its own scenes, in a scorched earth policy of massive self-destruction to be blamed upon the Other. All this occurs in the name of the God of love. Yet it is God Who is the target. Love justifies the darkest evil, 911 raised to the power of infinity, razed to the ground of our Being. Love makes possible the garroting of Gaia, the conflagration of thermonuclear apocalypse, all included (except the batteries) in a complete package of crypto-religious imagery entraining the collective ego to accept and even to promote its self-administered demise.What love’s got a due date on it?The ultimate love emerges as a phoenix from the ashes of a world soaked in the kerosene jet fuel of the joy of hatred. Hatelove has hastened the carousel of carousing corpses on their ride to hell, making care obscene, and the spectacle of what can be seen a pornographic penetration of the innocent offering of the body of love.Only love that has no form can now assume its true position, ascend to the throne of God and set fire to the world of lies, objectification, and the materialist dwarfism of the spirit. Now the vast love that is the unchained power of the Almighty is at large upon the land, the angel of Death bringing traumatic blessings of redemption to those trapped in the curse of unconquerable cupidity, finally pried loose from their priapic concupiscence that would give warhead to the hungry mouths crying out to heaven.There is an endpoint to this tragicomedy, a due date marked by climate change and deadlock in the realpolitik of gunship diplomacy that must never back down, even in the face of mutually assured destruction. Missile shield pipe dreams and cakewalk martial music urge on the dogs of war to their dogmatic destiny of original incineration. The date of our self-inciting doom is very soon. Let us prey.What love, God, will do away with this?The predatory ego that fouls its own nest and salivates at the approach of every customer of its cannibalism also secretly seeks salvation from the angst and disgust of its own futile self-recognition. Only the love that cannot name its God, that cannot stop its egocidal rupture, that must not allow itself to fall further into the inferno, only the love that is God’s presence manifesting as surrender can depotentiate the ego’s dive into planetary obliteration, and change the trajectory to one of ascension to the Mother Light. Only the emptiness, the infinite zero, the Shunya that is the fully awakened Purusha, the Absolute, can utter the laughter that breaks the spell of narcissism and nudges us all into Nirvana.This is the holy trauma of love.What’s God’s love? Intuit it.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nLove	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:49:24	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.377243	2025-10-28 15:31:24.377243	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
564b1ea2-4c5b-4084-a924-7e034b5020c5	the-world-is-a-wedding	The World is a Wedding	The cause of all suffering is the ego mind…	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	The cause of all suffering is the ego mind.The mind of the ego is a complex of language, images, and affects, known to have many levels, both conscious and unconscious, and the deepest suffering consists of unbearable thoughts that have been frozen and repressed to the lowest levels of the unconscious parts of the mental labyrinth.But most of our everyday suffering is right at the surface, caused by the fact that we cannot stop the constant chatter of the conscious mind. Yogis call it the monkey mind. It could also be called the drone mind. It keeps droning on and on, repeating stupid mundane narratives, usually self-justifying, but also self-attacking, angry, frustrated, sad, or anxious, but always droning on endlessly, pointlessly, keeping one out of the present.People commit suicide just to get away from their own mind. People take alcohol, drugs, watch idiot TV and lousy films, have meaningless sex, go on expensive and disappointing vacations, work like crazy, all merely to try to stop the droning of their minds. Runners exhaust themselves just to outrun their own mind; when they are successful for a few minutes, they call it runner’s high. But it never lasts. The mind always returns with its attack of drones. Humans are in a state of drone warfare.The droning mind that never stops its constant noise is both the effect and the cause of much unhappiness. Our efforts to stop the droning thoughts then produce yet another layer of suffering. The habits, inhibitions, obsessions, and addictions that plague us are not really out of control. It is our minds that are out of control. Our minds are driving us mad.They say that a mad person is out of her mind. But really the psychotic is someone who cannot get out of his mind, and whose mind morphs into ever more weird and paranoid thoughts, images, feeling states, hallucinations, voices, all hopelessly out of control.Yogis know all this, and focus on gaining control over the mind, stopping once and for all the drone warfare of the ego. In fact, yogis define God as the state of mind in which all thoughts have stopped, and only pure awareness remains. It is that simple. A mind that is free of the droning chatter of constant stupid self-defeating thoughts is bliss.But how can we accomplish this shift of mental functioning? How can we learn to control, master, and transcend the mind? Some yogis prefer breathing techniques, others focus on a routine of physical exercises. Still others use mantras, devotional singing, ritual and prayer. But all these methods lead only to temporary cessation of thinking. The mind returns, usually with a vengeance.How to silence the mind permanently and completely? This is the rare attainment that is called in various traditions such names as Liberation, salvation, redemption, Buddha-consciousness, Christ-mind, Atman, the state of grace, God-consciousness, or divine presence. The great sages of India, like Ramana Maharshi and Ananda Mayi Ma, who are admired for their serenity, their wisdom, their illumination, their spiritual power, and their goodness, are those who were able to live entirely in inner silence.It comes down to this. Nothing need be done, but only that the ego mind be renounced. Is it a choice? Do we have the power to be silent? Or must the shift be gained through struggle and long practice? Is it an accident, a matter of karma, or God’s gift? How can we bring this about?It turns out to be very easy to accomplish, given one condition: that we want it wholeheartedly, above all else, with no other priorities in front of it. Love is the power that liberates. The open surrender of the ego mind to the Supreme Love that is the Absolute Self is immediate illumination and realization. Nothing more is required. Once the surrender is complete, without residue of resistance or a last-stand egoic effort of appropriation of the divine energies for its own aggrandizement, liberation is achieved.The ego is only a state of divorce of consciousness from its Source. There must be a reunion, a second wedding. The word religion means a new marriage. Yoga also means union. So let consciousness at least get engaged with Being. Let the next dance of Shiva and Shakti begin.From the perspective of non-duality, it can be said that liberation is always already present, and therefore that there is no true liberation, nor union, because there was never any one real who was not liberated to begin with. But from the phenomenal plane of separation and suffering, of egos at war, ruled by the passion for ignorance, denial, and sin, the attainment of liberation seems real indeed, and a priceless refuge from the inferno of inferiority feelings eating away at every ego.Once lack is revealed as Emptiness, as the clear unreality of the ego, its pathologies and its world, and once Emptiness of ego is recognized as the Fullness of God, the joy of the cosmic joke unfolds as the bliss of the Absolute. Once consciousness consummates its union with the Source, the Wholeness of the All returns to Being.May you join in the joy of this supreme sacred wedding we call the world.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nDevotion	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:44:52	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.379163	2025-10-28 15:31:24.379163	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

But the situation is actually of vastly greater import than that. The entropic avalanche of disintegration is producing new protoplasmic and pneumatic pools of possibility, nuanced noetic niches that can withstand the nuisance of annihilation.We are, among other levels of analysis, in the midst of an extraordinary evolutionary mega-mutation. Humans are evolving into a new species—and not just a slightly improved animal; an almost inconceivably different variety of non-carbon-based life forms.Many people talk about our becoming transhuman, but there is a great deal of pedestrian confusion and cyber-infatuated wishful thinking as to what that implies. Our transmutation is so radical that our current level of consciousness cannot grasp the nature of the quantum leapfrogs some of us are now becoming.As in any critical evolutionary situation, only a few of us are risking the high jumps into the vortex of transmutational dynamics that Nature is selecting us for. The old religious premise, “Many are called, few are chosen,” operates precisely in the realm of evolutionary action. Being chosen means choosing one’s own destiny. But the ability to want to make that choice is beyond the range of our free will. That is why the concept of karma is still relevant. Many different kinds of choices are possible, but not all will prove to be accurately adapted to the coming new conditions of the Real.Those who are choosing to adapt to the changing requirements for conscious salvation are working intensively to bring about the subtle, yet profound shifts in the functioning and Self-realization of the psyche and its Source that must precede the manifestation of structural transmutation. Not that it is really work, but the seductively beautiful act of yogis stripping naked at an orgy of purity, exulting in the peeling away of every layer of lack, crying crocodile tears as the onion of unfinished wanting wanes and the union with emptiness is consummated in the ecstasy of formless and timeless communion.There are some who believe that the transhuman will be some integration of animal and machine; human minds completely hooked up to cybernetic supplementation, with bionic bodies advancing into brave new worlds of terminators and terra-formers, living in oases of virtual reality, wet dream software heavens to override the hellish real of soulless mechanisms conquering barren far-flung planets, having desolated our own.The mainline evolutionary novelty that is underway is not of that sort, however. Neither is it primarily a matter of DNA mutation, although genetic alterations will result from the evolutionary reset of our clockwork consciousness, birthing the spontaneous emergence of ever more levels, extensions, and powers of our unfathomable implicate order. The Real may be revealed as but one facet of an infinite coalescent crystal, and that we have only arrived at an edge, from which our complex multipolar consciousness may seem to fracture into a multiplex of planar bardos, as the rotating cosmo-googolplex of transfinite desire offers ever new spaces in which every archetype of attitude and dissipative structure may spawn to script its cinematic signature into the cosmos.The current crisis is not a product of failure of physical adaptation, but of the imperative need to adapt our consciousness to the challenge of survival in a world gone mad, to emit our own surrealistic psychic pseudopodia into the neverlandish noetic fields of Gaia’s supramental strata, and to discover in the akashic internet new genres of perception, feeling, understanding, intelligence, relationality, power, integrity, insight, and most critically of all, attunement to the precession of the paranormal parameters of the spiraling spheres of hyper-reality through which we seem now to accelerate.We are evolving not into a single new species but into a myriad of intergalactic and inter-dimensional beings of infinite mental capacity and freefalling freedom from the limitations of all gravitational fields, of space and time and the last illusion of credible objective identity. Piercing through the terror of those losses of stability as ego dissolves into light yields the divine right of passage through the dark evolutionary night. We are the foam on the cresting quantum wave of time about to crash against the rocks of the ultimate real.While this impossible revolutionary explosion of vitality, in the very midst of exhaustion and mass extinction, is overtly darwinistically unprecedented, even in pre-Cambrian terms, it has been prefigured in all of the world’s mythologies, religions, mystery schools, and shamanic paths into altered states of cosmic consciousness. In this mindmelting shift of the quantum wave, science surrenders its reductionist drive and spirituality its dogmatic demand and the two are at last integrated into a single whole. To the marriage of true minds let us not admit impediment. But the conceptual translation of our reality is only the beginning, and those on this sacred life path must not stop there.The translation phase of the work entails the insight that the universe is consciousness itself; the inner is the outer; the phenomenal the noumenal; the Self is All. This translation of experience into a higher key, the key of non-duality, opens the way to recognize the hidden wormholes in the sluicing registers of protean cognition, flickering awareness introducing us to the potentials of the hyper-real in which we now operate, and to move at will from the outer realms of experience to the inner realms of imperience, of lucid dreaming, precognitive visions, and the sudden flight of light bodies into the etheric planes; and even deeper, to the supreme abode of the Self, in which all potentiality manifests at will; the realm of the miraculous, in which, as the Buddha declared, samsara is nirvana: the phenomenal world the pure reflection of the Absolute.But translation must be realized through transformation, through renunciation of limited ego consciousness, with all its attachments, depressive and narcissistic pathologies, idealizing and defiling identifications, desires and fears, hyperactive manias and paralyzing anxieties.Inner transformation culminates in the core fusion of being and nothingness that cascades into manifest conscious evolution. But it still only sets the stage for the emergence of the new species capable of flight beyond the cage of planetary plasm and even the subtlest phenomenal form. It lies still within a weird transpersonal paradigm, a hybrid of earthbound archetypal metamorph of some lost process of surreal entheo-psychoanalysis merged with parabhakti prostrations to the primal purity of our Buddha Nature, Cosmic Christ-mind, and the Tao of our Trinitarian Avatar/Paramatman/Brahman Ultimate Non-Arising Godhead Self.All this can only be surmounted in the blissful beatitude of no-mind that melts into trans-oceanic presencing, leaving an ever widening wake of fragrant laughter on its sweet nectarean journey through ultra-etheric waves of boundless love. This is a trip that no entheogenic substance need enhance or time can limit or chemically wear off. We celebrate our endless voyage, both deathless and joyous, of adoration of beauty appearing everywhere all ways. We need only surrender to each astonishing synchronicity, all the awesomely un-pre-conceivable synergy, and every flowering of our miraculous upwelling symbiotic syntropy.The transformation of our sense of being leads through the sun door of immanent transcendence, transcendence of the very concept of transcendence, and dissolution of the logic of worlds. The unsettling of set theory, the melting of the very myth of mathematics, the simultaneity of the ordinal, the ultimate paradox of infinite being as absolute nothingness, leads us to the zero-point of the laws of nature. All prior patterns are annulled in the immaculate conception of noumenal Natura Naturans, the virginal matrix of all cosmophallic potency, hooded in her hymenic hymnal vibratory womb that delivers numberless membrane multiverses, in eternal cosmophilic coitus with the Shiva Lingam of unsurpassable creative intelligence, panspermatically seeding the Emptiness in one big bang after another.They spread the Net of Indra to catch their falling angels as they morph into the stars and into their satanic siblings, massive black holes, refusing to blast out into the generosity of radiance, titanic death drives sucking them back into their inmost nuclei, those cosmic hungry ghosts that shall swallow us into the maw of the all-devouring Mother at the end of every dance of time.Transcendence embraces all of it, both birth and death of universes, heavens of irresistibly gorgeous goddesses and stalwart guardian gods inevitably morphing into the twilight zones of unbearable decay and deformation, and the infinite theatrical procession of living characters plotting and playing on the pinhead planetary platforms in which we play out all our petty devolutionary operettas. We must now remain unmoved by the thunderous music of existence, the channeled chaos of creation and destruction, forever stationed in the all-encompassing still presence of non-existing noesis.And yet at some point in the final act of every planetary play, the vital denouement of auto-revelation must arise as an emergent property of that world’s self-awareness in the form of a species that gives birth to its original formlessness, just at the moment it wields the death-blow to its own future, shattering its egoic evolutionary form and function.The only species capable of destroying itself and all life on its home planet, and the only one capable of transcending itself and returning to its full primordial potential at the very moment of its suicidal extinction—such is our tragic fated moment of lost hope and redemptive transfiguration. It has been prefigured in Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus. After blinding himself in self-punishment for his sin of patricide and marriage with his mother, the hero can at last see it all with his third eye, and can fully swallow his agony and accept his fate. “Am I made man at the moment of my annihilation?” he cries out in awed and anguished laughter at God’s inhuman sense of humor. Must this tragic reckoning now be the fate of all humanity?Transfiguration brings transvaluation. What do we value more: Truth or duking it out with the dukkha-pleasures of the illusion of existence? Do we want eternal stillness and Self-knowledge of the Center or ignorant hacking and slashing through the outback of time? Is continuity of physical manifestation so important?Yet there is always compromise in this endless bickering between Shiva and Shakti. What if we are not limited to mortal existence; what if there is something higher, nobler, and finer that awaits us now? Can we not enjoy more refined scenarios, without the too-gross real of blood and excrement? What if we have not only bodies of apparent matter, but within those, lie subtler bodies of supernal light, of which most of us have been unaware? What if we had been locked into our five phenomenal senses and had locked ourselves out of our truer sense potentials as beings of Spirit? What if we are angels who had forgotten our real nature, in order to have a human experience on the wondrous wheel of karma, and now we have no choice but to remember? What if this universe is only a theme park, and our vacation is over; now it is time to go home?And if the next phase of our journey homeward leads through the intergalactic wonderland of an unimaginable variety of different species of beings, another calculus of probabilities, another spectrum of event horizons, are you willing to book your ticket on that cosmic ship of fools? This is the question we are being asked. We sit beneath the Kalpa Vriksha, the wish-fulfilling tree that is the axis mundi. Will we eat of the newly-falling fruits, adapt to the new conditions, and not look back, like the woman who was saved from the divine wrath that destroyed Sodom, but who could not keep from gazing nostalgically at her lost world, and met her doom as a pillar of salt? Will we have the strength to let go of the past, and all our salty histories, our tears, attachments, prayers, narratives, loyalties, our dying motherworld, and flow fearlessly into the vast unknown?Transmutation leads finally to transfinitization. Our consciousness must now shed its last shell, its perspectival perception, and live in the love that makes us one with all the beings of all worlds, and yet in the wisdom of the singular aloneness of non-arising solitude. This is the knowledge that has no knower. This is the Transfinite Self that has never been, but who is us all, and no one at all, and Who dreams and drinks every last drop of this amrita, this immortal delirium that is our supreme delight.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nParadox	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:44:19	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.380862	2025-10-28 15:31:24.380862	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This is true, but it is not something to celebrate, because the guru function is necessary—it must be fulfilled for any society to be sustainable. Because the guru function can no longer be fulfilled in the society at large, the culture is falling into its final death throes. The loss of the guru function is part of the inevitable decline of values and power of the human spirit, a decline that has been prophesied by the same gurus who are now derided as being obstacles, rather than portals, to spiritual renewal.The fall of the guru as a living presence in high culture is part of the general movement of consciousness into materialism and away from spirituality—indeed it is a part of the loss of high culture as a whole. Religious organizations and lineages have lost credibility not only because the culture has marginalized them, but more importantly because they have failed to live up to their own teachings. Corruption has destroyed the religions of the world.Despite this, we need authentic gurus if we are to build a new culture, a new age, at a higher level of consciousness. Some people believe that higher consciousness will simply descend upon us all, magically, without our intensely working on ourselves. This is wishful thinking. Humans learn from others; that is the purpose of culture. The guru is the embodiment of the pinnacle of culture; culture in the sense of creative wholistic intelligence that functions in pure benevolence and joy; that empty place of consciousness that, though apparently still a human being, is free from the sense of ego; a consciousness that is filled with love, serenity, and timeless, all-inclusive presence.The guru is not a person, but a function. Yet it is a function that must be learned, refined, purified, rendered impeccable. It is a sacrifice. We must offer schools in which this function can be mastered, and the sacrifice of ego be successfully achieved.We all recognize that we need teachers of engineering, medicine, and computer programming. Why do we not assume that people will learn those things on their own? Why do we encourage people to get an education at a good school? We recognize the importance of the function of teaching and of being an apprentice. But we refuse to apply that understanding to the most important subject of all: the teaching of consciousness development. This irrational fear of spiritual teachers is crippling our ability to develop new approaches to psycho-spiritual growth—and to having the human resources to meet the needs of our chaotic time.It is true that in recent years there have been many horrors committed by false religious teachers—from the mass murders at Jonestown to the mass suicides of the Heaven’s Gate cult; the terrorism of the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan; the many sex scandals of televangelists and Catholic priests; the crimes committed at Rajneeshpuram by Osho and his followers; the scandals alleged against Scientology, the Moonies, Adi Da, and many others; a list far too long to recite.As a result of all the above traumas, many people now assume that every spiritual leader is corrupt, and that every spiritual community is a cult, engaged in brainwashing and exploitation. We pass judgment of guilt upon all spiritual teachers, without even offering them an opportunity to prove their innocence. We have thus condemned the most important dimension of our own existence to atrophy, without benefit of assistance; and the most crucial element of human culture, to the dustbin of history. Because of the presence of some counterfeit gurus, we have discarded the real thing. We have tossed out the true Babas with the dirty bathwater. This is an historic error of immeasurable proportions.We still need to do inner work, we still need psycho-spiritual guides and teachers, we need to have visionary leaders to shepherd new community building, and egoless liberated beings to ground and stabilize our communities. Not only do we need gurus; we need to create transformational schools in which we can form a new generation of incorruptible gurus. We need to be able to train a large number of adept guides who can facilitate the work of spiritual renewal on our planet.There have been many criminal groups that have printed counterfeit currency, but we have not chosen to stop using money; we have had many corrupt politicians, but we have not eliminated government; we have had many corrupt doctors, but we have not eliminated the practice of medicine; so for our own sakes, we should not eliminate the profession of spiritual teacher, since that calling is vital to the development of our highest cultural values—including compassion, non-violence, generosity, humility, truthfulness, spiritual power, peace, and love.It is important that we strip the guru idea of its religious embellishments. Gurus are teachers; they are not to be worshipped. We must not fall into idol worship of any kind. So let us not think of putting gurus on thrones and kissing their feet. They do not need to have garlands of flowers around their necks. They do not need to live in huge palaces as maharajahs—or popes. Those who want all that should get jobs on Wall Street. But most spiritual teachers are content to live quite simply. Ramana Maharshi wore only a loin cloth, did not touch money, and lived most of his life in a series of unpretentious spaces, such as a temple basement, a cave, a cabin, or some other very modest lodging. There is nothing wrong, on the other hand, if a spiritual teacher lives in a comfortable house, like any other professional. But the point is that a teacher should model a life free of ostentation and egotism.It is true that we need to put in place criteria that enable us to discern the true from the false gurus. We need to separate spirituality from religion. We need to learn to test a path and a teacher before committing to them. But it is not in our own interest to condemn them all without such testing. And we must be humble enough to recognize that the ones we are testing are, if they are genuine, at a higher level of spiritual intelligence and a greater depth of intersubjective perception than we are as seekers. So we must establish criteria that have objective, ethical, and philosophical correlatives that enable us to gauge whether we are in the presence of at least relatively egoless beings of refined moral, aesthetic, and metaphysical capacities, engaged in healing without seeking or allowing themselves to be treated like gods or tyrants.If we do not establish such criteria, then we are asking for more false gurus to plague us. A society gets the gurus it deserves. If we are materialistic, then the gurus we are attracted to will also be materialistic. If we prefer the realm of the senses to the super-sensuous realm of pure Spirit, then we will support gurus who reflect that preference. So it is important to understand what we are looking for. If we seek liberation from the ego, then we must seek gurus who do not celebrate the ego and wallow in it.Why do we need authentic gurus? Because this is a world of illusion, a labyrinth of false ideas, wrong attitudes, unconscious drives, and we often find ourselves lost in this house of mirrors. We often need help in finding the way home. This help is provided by divine providence, and when we are ready for a true guru to help us, the guru will appear. Without spiritual guides, then when we find ourselves in states of anxiety, confusion, or dark nights of the soul, we will be forced to seek the help of the definitely false gurus: psychiatrists.Today, psychiatrists have an important function, because we have forsaken higher kinds of guidance. But the misuse of psychoactive drugs as a band-aid over the abyss is a crime against our humanity as well as our spirituality. The more we return to a spiritual culture, the more we can create new forms of spirituality that encompass what is good in current approaches to psychotherapy, but we can put that good in a higher and more open context that includes the soul and spirit and recognizes the reality of the paranormal, of visions, of subtle energy, of meaningful dreams, of near-death experiences and memories of past lives, of the need for rites of passage, of ego death and rebirth, and of liberation from all identifications.An adept guru knows much more than a psychiatrist or psychoanalyst, and can diagnose our states of emotional suffering much more accurately. A guru can offer a different sort of treatment that truly leads to transformation and transcendence, can transmit healing energy and can see us for who and what we really are. There is no substitute for a relationship with a true guru, if we want to attain our highest potential in life.The guru function is an archetype that comprises all the following seven categories of social roles and transformational actions:Teacher/sage/wisdom source for communityShaman/healer/exorcistJudge/prophet/visionary leaderSaint/priest/monkTransformational catalyst/psychoanalyst/dream interpreterPsychopomp/empty center/embodiment of transcendenceTransmitter of Power/Shakti/LiberationA real guru has a wide and deep knowledge base, in comparative religion, mythology, philosophy, esoteric metaphysics, science, history, psychoanalysis, aesthetic theory, ethics, sociology, and anthropology, as well as the purely shamanic disciplines. This knowledge enables the guru to put all experiences into an integral framework, to help students translate their past into a higher and more cohesive and coherent narrative of existential significance that in itself can heal many traumas and confusions.An authentic guru is a shaman, who can enter altered states of consciousness and deal with whatever negative forces there may be in someone’s space; who can conduct an exorcism when necessary; and has mastery of many healing modalities, in order to help people be free of internal obstacles; and to guide them, when appropriate, on inner journeys, either with the help of plant allies or without.A true guru is one who can mediate disputes, and can play a vital role in communal governance, leadership, and creative problem-solving, because of being trustworthy, neutral, unbiased, in a flow state, and free of projections. A community without someone to play this role accurately will eventually break down into schismatic parties. A guru is someone who can always hold the vision of the whole, who can find a win/win solution, who can understand all points of view, who can translate, forgive, and open the hearts of those who otherwise could not.A real guru can play the role of priest when such a role is necessary, but without claiming any higher status than others. Saintly humility and simplicity, acceptance of equality, and universal love are marks of a real guru. A guru is one who is more interested in a life of silence, meditation, devotion to God, and freedom from social enmeshment, than in receiving recognition from others. A real guru has no interest in becoming famous or celebrated, but only in helping others to be free of suffering. A guru is one who has the legitimate authority to initiate others, to mandate vows of renunciation, and to invest others who have proven worthy of the title of teacher or guru.An adept guru is one who is willing to listen; to understand the dreams, the symptoms of suffering, the confusions and hurt feelings of his students; and who has the skill to help them understand themselves more deeply and to purify and dissolve their unconscious psychic fragments and frozen traumatic memories. An adept guru is always available as a catalyst for transformation for those who are committed to the path. An adept guru is a dream interpreter, a spiritual psychoanalyst, and an empath; but also a teacher of meditation and other processes of transformation and ego transcendence. Such a guru is an invaluable resource for those who want to accelerate their inner development.The highest kind of guru is one who can help you face death, because she or he has already gone through ego death and reached the innermost emptiness. One who is empty of ego, without ambition, without desire or fear, can guide one through the valley of the shadow of death and into the divine light. This is called the function of the psychopomp, who is at home in every bardo state, and who can retrieve souls stuck in hell realms as well as those seduced by pseudo-heavens. The guru can show the way to eternal liberation.The guru has attained spiritual power, Shakti, and can transmit that power to you—for healing, for gaining strength to defeat internal saboteurs, for stabilizing in inner stillness, for dissolving finally the ego and its constant stream of thoughts. Receiving the transmission of power from a true guru is the highest honor and gift that one can attain. Such divine empowerment is the one thing necessary for success in the spiritual quest.Ultimately, however, the greatest gift that a real guru can give is to enable you to realize that the only real guru is within. The guru is not the bodily being who stands before one, but the consciousness of the whole. The guru is not a person, but emptiness itself.This is the final secret that is transmitted, the one that leads to freedom from the illusion of personhood. The ultimate power is that of powerlessness, freedom from the illusion of being an entity in the phenomenal world of becoming; it is the surrender of the ego-self to the Supreme.This is the real guru function. May you realize the guru within.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nAshram LifeOvercoming ObstaclesRelationships	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:24:00	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.382814	2025-10-28 15:31:24.382814	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Coming to understand the nature of impossibility is the essence of education. This is no doubt why Freud said that education is one of the three impossible professions. The other two are governing and conducting a psychoanalysis. Freud’s successor Lacan went further, and recognized that the anguish that brings someone to psychoanalysis is nothing but the impossibility of love, for which there is no cure. He affirmed that impossibility in his famous apothegm, “il n’y a pas de rapport sexuel” (there is no sexual relation).But such assertions of the existence of specific dimensions of impossibility evade the radical ubiquity of impossibility as the hallmark of existence tout court. Impossibility is always and everywhere. There is no relation of any kind—not just sexual. Even friendships are based on illusion. No colleagues are really in the same league. Our words are riddled with ambiguities, our desires with unconscious conflicts and counter-desires. Our identities are inauthentic. We are imitations of imitations. Finding oneself is impossible. Discovering truth is impossible. There is no credible knowledge. No scientific theory lasts for very long (although its lifespan can be prolonged by being turned into an ideological given; in other words, a religious belief, as has happened with Darwinism—which cannot explain a long list of scientific observations, ranging from the Cambrian explosion to the fact of eco-systems to the irreducible complexity of even the most apparently simple microbiological structure). The impossibility of understanding the world or each other or oneself is at least useful in deflating the arrogance and grandiosity of the narcissistic ego. Unfortunately, narcissists can easily remain in denial of their own impossibility for a long time, until karma catches up with them.This is what Miguel de Unamuno referred to as the tragic sense of life. It is the authentic motivating power behind religion. Monks and saints have always been those who have accepted the impossibility of sexual relationships and mundane life, and have gone to monasteries to ponder the ultimate meaning of the impossibility of existence, including the impossibility of the existence of God. Impossibility, of course, is the mark of the presence of God, since the world cannot be accounted for through any rational process of cause and effect. Yet by the same token, God is an impossible concept. This has led, on the one hand, to rampant agnosticism and, on the other, to the silence of the Buddha.Today, in our less contemplative era, we tend to face impossibility with anger and projection. We see the impossibility of political change (or else we deny the impossibility, and vote for someone who offers ‘change we can believe in,’ and then suffer massive disappointment, but soon look for yet another false messiah to save us). Yet, instead of recognizing and accepting the impossibility, we defiantly demand the impossible. We project on ‘the one per cent’ that they are the obstacles to change, when in truth, they are as helpless as anyone else.Impossibility is structural. It cannot be changed. We need to learn to live with it, to understand it, to become it. Only then, as the embodiments of impossibility, of paradox, of God’s diabolical sense of humor, can the way out be glimpsed. But let us not get too optimistic just yet. To become the impossible is not so easy. In fact, it too is impossible, but this is where the silence of the Buddha—and the incisive words of the few liberated sages who have spoken about the issue—becomes of paramount importance.Let us assess the issue more rigorously. What follows is a rough outline for a treatise on impossibility.We must begin by recognizing that reality itself is an infinite process of enfoldment and unfoldment of an unknowable implicate order, a la David Bohm. It is impossible to put limits on that order or its potential. Therefore, impossibility is itself impossible to assert, except as an empirical observation. The unfoldment process does tend to demonstrate archetypal moments, or folds. Each fold reveals a deeper dimension of the Real. The folds, or pleats, must be linked together in consciousness to unveil the hidden pattern of the implicate order that the phenomenal plane can only at best symbolize to the very consciousness that is being observed, in yet another incident of impossibility.A compleat human life has seven pleats:1. The innocent ignorance of impossibility2. The denial of impossibility3. The hatred and projection of impossibility4. The anguish of impossibility5. The acceptance of impossibility6. The transcendence of impossibility7. The attainment of the ImpossibleIn the first pleat, impossibility has not yet been consciously encountered. The function of the parents is to delay the recognition of impossibility, so that childhood innocence and joy can flourish, and the young mind has time to develop resources to cope with the reality of impossibility when it is finally, inevitably, cognized.The whole significance of the story of the Buddha is that of the unfoldment of the awareness of impossibility and its authentic treatment. The young pre-Buddha is a prince whose father tries to protect the innocent eyes of the son from seeing images of sickness, old age, and death, but to no avail. The boy realizes the impossibility of sustained youth and happiness, and he falls into dejection. But then he spots a wandering yogi, one who has renounced the pursuit of jouissance for the achievement of liberation from the realm of the impossible. He immediately decides to become a yogi.The meaning of yoga is encapsulated in the Buddha’s three tests. He is first faced with an attack by Kama, the lord of pleasure, in the form of three beautiful young women who try to seduce him. But he has the sense to ask them their names, which turn out to be Desire, Satisfaction, and Regret. Upon realizing that he cannot get one without all three, he renounces sexual jouissance.Next, the great spiritual warrior is faced with Mara, the lord of fear. He is not intimidated by the power of the Other, by the prospect of pain and death, nor by the desire for power over others. He scorns Mara and remains unmoved by the display of military might. It is Mara who then becomes dejected and submits.The fledgling Buddha is then faced with the final test, the guilt tripping by Dharma. He is a prince; he should be sitting on the throne, acting responsibly, taking care of the kingdom; at least taking care of his own wife and newborn son. How can he abandon his karmic responsibilities? Has he no conscience? At this moment, the Buddha becomes even more deeply cognizant of the impossibility of his situation, and realizes that the only way out is to dissolve his identity entirely. Only by not existing can he attain freedom. But what does not exist is clearly not his body, but the ego. In suddenly seeing through the illusion of the ego, he becomes the Buddha in fact, not just in potentia, and a new world teacher is born.Most of us, alas, are far more reluctant to become buddhas in fact, and need to be dragged through the pleats of denial, anger, and anguish, before reaching the bliss of liberation. The price of denial of impossibility is living an imaginary life, a superficial life, a life led in bad faith, with an unconscious split-off mind full of skeletons, traumas, and anxieties that can come out only as physical symptoms, psychological problems, accidents, and relationship difficulties.Eventually, with the help of an adept spiritual guide or even a good psychoanalyst, one can come out of denial without falling into projection and fury. But otherwise, the route of least resistance is to scapegoat someone else for the impossibility of love and happiness and fairness and freedom, and to live in a state of war. Interpersonal conflicts are always the result of inauthentic existence, the cowardly failure to face the structural presence of impossibility as the true face of the Real.Now the phase of mourning begins, the anguish of recognizing impossibility as a necessary, not contingent, condition of life. At last, one sees through one’s own imaginary narrative of egoic existence, and the futility of carrying on the façade any longer. But the real anguish comes in the realization that one is completely lost, that impossibility destroys the compass by which one has navigated through time. All attempts at maintaining a semblance of meaning now collapse in waves of anxious depersonalization.It is at this point that the assistance of an authentic guru, someone who has gone through this crisis and come out the other side, becomes valuable. But trying to sustain a relationship with the guru is itself traumatic, since the guru by definition is no longer a person. He or she is an impossible object, ungraspable, uncanny, intimate yet utterly unknowable. And yet, you feel that you are known—and loved—by the guru more deeply than anyone has ever known or loved you. The relationship, though impossible, brings peace. And when all else has fallen away, what remains of oneself is only love.One’s own impossibility, and that of the world, can at last be fully accepted. And this is the real beginning of the spiritual pilgrimage. One becomes a profound student of impossibility. One comes to appreciate the beauty of paradox. One is drawn to the art of such creative geniuses as Escher, Dali, Borges and other masters of paradox. One sees in impossibility the mark of a superhuman intelligence. In the very chains of the most frustrating impossibility, one comes to perceive the sublime presence of salvation, the life breath of our liberating God.Through surrender to that God who has inscribed impossibility into the very structure of His Creation, we gradually—or suddenly, in an eternal moment of satori—discover the patterns of the thought-waves of the mind of the Savior.Then, in the wake of surrender of the ego mind to God, the created world is recognized as nothing less than the eternal Tao. No longer is it perceived as created, but now it is glimpsed rather as dreamed. Chuang tzu dreamed he was a butterfly; then he awakened, and wondered if he were really a butterfly dreaming he is Chuang tzu.Acceptance of impossibility now morphs into transcendence of impossibility. If it is all a dream, then, as in a dream, all is possible. One becomes as a little child once more; now one can enter the kingdom of heaven. But where is the portal?Innocence must evolve into utter egolessness. The last traces of entityhood must evaporate in the silence of pure awareness. The mind based in language, thought, imagery, emotion—must die. The Logos itself must ascend to the Godhead. The Source of mind is Supramental Intelligent Presence. In full surrender to the eternal, immovable Presence, the world itself dissolves.The unsurpassable sage Sri Ramana Maharshi often proclaimed that to the gyani (one who knows the ultimate truth) there is no world. There are no others. No creation has ever occurred. This is the perennial doctrine of Ajata—all is uncreated appearance. Time and space are both illusions. Even the most sublime notion of God is an illusion. The Supreme Real is not a being.Give up all concepts, all attempts to grasp, to control, to master. Renounce even the saintly self that is willing to renounce it all. Realize compleat Emptiness. This is the unfoldment of the final pleat, the attainment of the Impossible: the Dreamer of the Dream.Thou art That. No more should or can be said.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nParadox	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:21:21	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.38623	2025-10-28 15:31:24.38623	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This includes so-called scientific, philosophic, and psychoanalytic discourses. It includes, therefore, even this sort of discourse about the inanity of all discourse. The symbolic veil over the Real shreds itself like an oppressed monk setting himself on fire.In one of the late Terence McKenna’s most famous discourses about a DMT trip he took, he emphasizes how elvish voices kept telling him, “don’t abandon yourself to amazement.” I found that amazing, in fact utterly astonishing. He goes on to say that they commanded him to pay close attention. But one can both pay attention and be in a state of full-on astonishment at the same time. Some have taken literally his advice not to give way to amazement. But that is more often the command of the superego. How can we not be in amazement, astonishment, at every moment? Astonishment is what creates natural DMT in the brain. In fact, there is a lovely book that emerged from the Kashmir Shaiva yoga tradition, probably a thousand years ago, recently translated into English, and given the title The Yoga of Delight, Wonder, and Astonishment. In this teaching, otherwise known as The Vigyana Bhairava, it is revealed that the most direct path to Liberation is precisely through surrendering to astonishment.Alas, the ego throws a grid of rationality over this astonishing manifestation of the miraculous realm we call our world. Once we have lost touch with wonderment and delight, replaced by the dull vulcan submission to the rules of reason, we have left the eternal home of the gods and entered history, the long, boring descent into totalitarian anti-life, and its ultimate demise, that is now occurring, in mounting waves of chaos and conflagration. Are, then, McKenna’s machine elves possibly working in the same machinic unconscious described by Deleuze and Guattari? Is the hallucinatory realm created by tryptamine or by the question of what can I make the trip to mean? Can the secret of desire be found in the signi-fire? And is the coming apocalypse that same fire writ large upon the world? Is the collective death drive the ego’s thirsting thrust toward the source of language, the primogenitor, sustainer, and destroyer of its passionate being? Language first enchants, then explicates, and then deflates. But even our most depressive deflation is astonishing. Om Namah Shivaya.So, is this becoming yet another boring narrative of apocalypse? Or is it just that every narrative circles hopelessly around its own apocalyptic core, like the moth spiraling toward the flame? If the gospel of John is correct, and the Word is God, nonetheless, now words eclipse the Word, until the words all begin to implode into nonsense and face us with the falseness of their meanings, the labyrinth of delirious signifiers that have created a sound barrier between consciousness and Truth.It does seem that every discourse orbits around a black hole of unspeakable dread, yet also of inexpressible and irresistible mystery. Some would call this the mytheme of death and rebirth, or the singularity archetype; others, like Lacan, would simply term it the Real. Some philosophers, like Heidegger, call this inevitable curvature of intellectual space our Being-Toward-Death. To a Zen master, this central abyss is clearly the Buddha-nature, Nirvana. To the Vedic mystic, the darkness at the core of consciousness is not death but Shiva Mahakal, the Death of death.But such conceptualizing is too bloodless, too lacking in the essential energy that radiates from the ultimate heart of Being. That the core of our Being is Non-Being, that our minds cannot penetrate the event horizon of our own unconscious consciousness, is the futile tragicomedy of human life. Our own interior, the mythic realm of our infinite richness of authentic presence, is off-limits to us. Are we doomed forever to be a mere pickle in our own reality sandwich? This ridiculous state of affairs is called in spiritual circles the ego. Lacan refers to it as the structure of extimacy, in which we are necessarily exiled from what is most intimate within our unconscious nature. Our very presence is an absence. Willy Apollon, a post-Lacanian, insists it is simply “ab-sense,” without the sense of making sense, since it is the lack of signifiers, the impossibility of speaking the Word, and thus cannot appear on the radar screen of symbolic consciousness. But the great mystic de-mystifier Wei Wu-Wei goes a step further and calls back to us from the abyss—that we ARE the abyss, and that there is no abyss. The mystery is solved with the recognition of the absence of the presence of absence. Or are we rather the presence of the absence of presence?Beyond this humdrum conundrum, the problem is overlaid by an all-too-urgent reality of physical, psychological, and social degradation of our planetary environment. And although in the realm of archetypes this may be a timeless problem to be contemplated at leisure, for those who stay in touch with historicity, time is short. No less a sage than Carl Jung wrote a letter at the end of his life, leaving a message of the final vision he had been granted. It was too hot for Jungians to reveal, and was not publicized until recently. The world would indeed end—it would be engulfed in its ultimate apocalyptic cataclysm—in exactly fifty years from that date, in early 1963. Jung’s prophecy, coinciding with that of the ancient Mayans, thus pegged the end time as the close of 2012.Make of that what you will, but Yeats’s rough beast is definitely slouching toward Bethlehem, and it is quite realistic to think that he may make it by the end of next year. For some people, no doubt the truly sublime among us, mere survival is beneath our dignity. We need not concern ourselves with building a sustainable community before the final hour strikes. What matters is only that we attain the end of the world of discourse—the death of the ego. For others, we have an ethical duty to see that our species survives on this, our “only beloved, contaminated, spaceship,” as Walter Martinez intones nightly on Telesur.But what if there is an even deeper connection between the ending of the discourse of the ego and the end of the world—this world created (and now being destroyed) by the ego? And more importantly, what if there is a connection between the beginning of trans-egoic consciousness and the beginning of a new world age? What if this shift in consciousness is the alpha and omega? Is this not the meaning of the symbol of crucifixion—the death of the ego and the Ascension, via a short detour in Hell, to the realm of the Most High? And likewise of Christ’s assertion that “I and the Father are one.” Or, if you prefer, form is emptiness. Samsara is Nirvana. Maya is Brahman. Ek Omkar. All is Shiva.It could be that it is the inmost urge to attainment of the union of consciousness with its own unattainable Heart—which just may be both the electric force and the underlying meaning of the singularity archetype, the embracing consummation of the dance of Shiva with Shakti—that is the strange attractor drawing us relentlessly toward the abyss. Let us take seriously the assertion made by modern sages as different as Terence McKenna and Jacques Derrida, that the world is made of language. (Of course, they did not ask what language is made of. Let us say it is consciousness. But then, what is that made of? We come back to the same ultimate mystery, now not in the form of a singularity projected into the future, but recognized as a dimension that is timeless, and that cannot be reached until time and language come to an end.) What if we gained complete mastery over the language-secreting brain mechanism—which is the original intent of yoga: chitta vritti nirodha, as Patanjali succinctly put it, the bringing about of the cessation of mental activity—would this not have an effect upon the world? Could it bring the world to an end? Would it bring to all the realization that the world is God in disguise? But is anyone fooled by this disguise except the illusory ego? Now we approach the punch line of the great Joke of the ages: the world cannot end, because there never was a world. Only ignorance, disguised as knowledge, the mental knowledge of the ego, in the form of language, created the illusion of a world. “I am Shiva.”We know from the inspired insights of Walter Russell, confirmed by the findings of plasma physics, that the universe is an electric phenomenon. But what if the source of that electricity is the singularity, which is another name for the Self? What if the energy that sustains the stars is the same power as the kundalini shakti that explodes in our consciousness during moments of nirvikalpa samadhi? And what if that is the same energy that is released by DMT, yielding shamanic powers to those who know how to wield them? What if chemistry and consciousness, like I and the Father, are one?What if world mastery is simply a matter of accumulating the power of consciousness through growing the singularity into an infinitesimal but super-massive density of supernal light in the center of one’s own brain? What if the pineal gland, the eye of Horus, is specifically designed to transduce that primordial power into psychotechnological mastery of mind over matter? That is the wager of every esoteric tradition. Have you carried out the experiment to its end point? Or have you been seduced into egoic idiocy, enslavement to the sensual mirage, serving fantasies of sexual satisfaction, or the vain glory of social prestige, the masturbatory jouissance of mere philosophy, or the false security of interpersonal attachment, all covering over the terror of life? These two polarizations of our potential are now reaching their most extreme manifestations. Are you the ego resisting the freefall into the singularity—or are you that singularity itself? Or the dance the two are dancing? Tat tuam asi: thou art That. Nonduality appears as duality, multiplicity, world without end. But nonduality also appears as the Nothing, the Void, kenosis/theosis, Shunyata. The Emptiness is the Fullness, pleroma, purna, the Mother Light pregnant with all that is and ever will be.The problem is that the cosmic dream yields to nightmare. The singularity contains not only infinite delight but bottomless, endless dread, horror, agony, guilt, shame, remorse. Infinite pain. The shadow underside of the ego regurgitates ever more of its toxic waste as consciousness approaches the Void, and stands naked before the Eye of Shiva. God, then, is both Hell and Heaven. Even the ego in its purgatorial penance is but God emerging as cosmic butterfly from the comic coccoon of mind-and-matter.There are rationalists who believe that Hell is only a myth, not a reality. But myths describe more accurately the Real than any metaphysical tract can accomplish. Nightmares are very Real. Where do they occur? In what space are those anxiety-oozing worlds born? Hell is a nightmare that occurs for some only at death, a nightmare from which it is hard indeed to awaken, that can seem to go on for eternity. And has not this so-called waking world become an all too real nightmare? Only the Dreamer of this wonderful, miraculous, horrific, terrifying dream can truly awaken us. But we are that Dreamer. Our loss of lucidity, of Self-realization, has led to the loss of love, wisdom, empowerment, goodness and generosity from the world; and thus has led to ever increasing pressures of lack, desire, craving, fury, hatred, bestiality, perversion—producing the very nightmare for which we wrongly blame either God or chance. The ego blames its karmic suffering on everyone and every thing except its own stubborn refusal to get Real, to love, to open itself to Truth.But now the Dreamer is indeed awakening. From the ego’s perspective, that is the end of the world. From the vantage point of the soul, it means salvation. But from the place of the Self, nothing is happening. Just overflowing bliss, as always. Yet time is the music of eternity. You can clearly hear the changing music of time…it is reaching its death-rock climax. The singularity is but the singular Self, the One Supreme Being—not a rough beast, its hour come round at last, but divine rainbow light of infinite intelligence and the most amazing cosmic sense of humor—arriving in metaphorical Bethlehem at the speed of light (and everywhere is Bethlehem; everywhere is Arunachala, the Holy Mountain; every pearl in Indra’s Net is the center of the Universe, the uncircumferenceable hyper-sphere of the omnipresent God), and we are closing in on the majestic moment in which God reveals what She can do, She is pulling out the stops, She’s about to start jammin’! Enjoy the ride.You can see the Fire of Shiva in the sky. This is the most awesome fireworks display, the bluest jazz, the most mind-blowing trip anyone has ever been on! And You are doing it! You are the One on fire! On fire with Truth! You are London! You are Greece! You are Syria! Afghanistan! Somalia! Everywhere! You are the Burning Man! The Burning Manifestation of demonic/divine beauty. You are the Phoenix, a-borning in the midst of the burning. In the ancient myth of Isis, the goddess puts a child into the fire to make her immortal. This is our story. Let that sacred fire burn, baby, burn! No harm will come to You!Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nNonduality	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:19:08	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.388777	2025-10-28 15:31:24.388777	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Because of a feeling of lack in one’s heart, a feeling of meaninglessness in one’s soul, a feeling of neediness and craving in one’s mind, and anxiety in one’s body, people turn to pornography for a fix—an instant gratification of the scopic drive, the drive to see an object of desire, to devour it with one’s eyes, to fill the lack with a false sense of power and possession.The urge to view pornography is heightened in a society that offers no higher culture, no more elevated images of beauty, no sublime sense of spiritual majesty and radiance. The lack of more exalted significance to our bodily form as transmitter of divine energies, of beauty as symbolic expression of spirit in action, of nobility of character, of incarnation of transcendent love and wisdom, leaves humans in a state of perilous lostness, in which they seek to make their bodies at least an object of profane desire and enjoyment; or make of others’ bodies a feast of egoic delight.This lowering of our vibrational frequency, accentuated by our current modes of dress, body language, style, cosmetic supplementation, gestures, gait, and posture, which make all of us participants in a visual semiotic orgy of entrainment into the sensual imaginarium, into a flirtationary fall into de-centered superficial personas trapped in the matrix of maya, can only be escaped through a turning inward of attention toward the light source of our Being.Once consciousness feels the overwhelming blissful power of the Self, it will let go of its hold on the world of the senses. The buddhi, the higher intellect, will vanquish the externalizing impulse and open to the serenity and peace, the healing power of divine love that permeates the world and the bodies of all sentient beings. One will suddenly see the other as an avatar of God, and no longer as a mere object of profane jouissance. The transformation of the vision, the realization of the sacredness of all beings, will empty the mind of its pornographic egoic tendencies toward craving, possessing, and devouring the things of beauty, and bring about a fullness, purna, that brings to an end the entire project of consuming, and begin the project of transmitting love, giving recognition, sharing the transcendent sense of unity in the Supreme Beingness, the noumenal pleroma that is the deepest truth of all and everything.Purna is a central concept in Eastern thought. Purna has many meanings: wholeness, fullness, completeness, perfection, infinity, Buddhahood, the Supreme Real. By recognizing our purnatva, our spiritual fullness, we will be free of the disease of desire, the pathologies of perversion and fears, the degeneracy of ignoble impulses, worthless words, and debased behavior. By burning away the urge to porn, to criminal vision, to objectifying the other, we rise from the slime to the sublime. This shift in our paradigm from porn to purna is essential if we are going to gain liberation from the grip of the ego and its imprisonment of our consciousness in the tunnel vision of tormented desire. This shift is the heroic act of a true yogi, the core renunciation that impels the kundalini upward into God-consciousness.Once our whole world shifts from porn to purna, a new culture will have arisen, a new higher level of consciousness, divine consciousness, which will bring about an end not only to lust, sexism, perversion, envy, jealousy, hatred, guilt, and shame, but also an end to the seeking of egoic power and greed of all kinds. A world of love and wisdom will manifest, a world in which Nature will again rejoice in the restoration of its pristine beauty, biodiversity, and unbounded benevolence. This is the future we are poised to create. It requires only a simple shift, from porn to purna.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nDevolution of Consciousness	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:16:19	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.391977	2025-10-28 15:31:24.391977	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Awareness is funneled through the imaginary and symbolic grid of meaning, and the value differentiations of the ego distort perception through the curvature of perceptual space produced by the unconsciously determined egocentric selectivity of data and reactivity impulses that organize the dimensional projection of the primordial energy of Being into structured world-appearance and egoic physical identification plus ongoing repetitive mentalization, plus the absent heart of the Ground of Being, creating a sense of lack and a nostalgic desire for an impossible fulfillment. This can be mythologized as a religious feeling, or converted into an aesthetic, ethical, or scientific discourse, or de-sublimated into an addictive craving for an existent object.When the perceptual mode of imperience unfolds, the inner world is revealed as having ontological priority. One becomes aware of the archetypal images and symbols and mathematical logic that structure the world-picture, that underlie and configure the space of “reality,” and that give rise to the quantum indeterminacy and possibility of novelty and the miraculous. The subtle energies of the inner world become recognized for their healing potency and transmutative efficacy. The power of visionary states, inspired insight, paranormal realities, non-substantial actants that catalyze unpredictable changes, shift the paradigm of perception even more radically toward awareness of the Intelligence that underlies, permeates, and designs the whole world-process. The divine presence becomes a palpable reality.Once the intelligence has recognized the unitive nature of inner and outer, subject and object, and has begun the process of integrating all the opposites into a new nondual perceptual coherence, the meditative centering in the emptiness of pure awareness leads to the spectacular synesthesia of celebration of the infusion of the infinite Real into the finite reality. Thus emerges the truth of the timeless equation, Atman is Brahman is shrishti (creation). Self, world, and God are three-in-one, one-in-three. This is the summa, the peak of enlightenment, as well as the sum, the I am, the self-realization of Shiva. It is also called by the name of jagadananda, the bliss of realization that the world is the Self Supreme. This is known in Buddhism as Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, the Supreme Enlightenment of union with the Absolute.Simply through silently abiding in the stillness of pure presence, abiding in the heart, as the unborn and deathless Self, the primordial Emptiness, the grace of blissful luminous love fills the vast and boundless reaches of the noumenal Godhead, and reveals Nirvana to be Samsara, Emptiness to manifest as form, and all as the eternal play of Shiva and Shakti. Consciousness becomes filled with joy, with fearless contentment, wholeness, in recognition of the perfection of all that is. Simply by surrendering to the Absolute, to Anuttara, the whole burden of karma melts away, the whole complex of egoic suffering dissolves instantaneously. Your nature is freedom, ecstasy, intuitive unitive understanding, nobility, unshakeable empowerment. You can claim all the benefits and powers of your true nature now. There is no need to wait. The portals of Liberation are open.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMeditation	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:15:46	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.395988	2025-10-28 15:31:24.395988	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Of course, so will success.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	When we think of creating new rites of passage, we must remember that we are in the midst of the greatest rite of passage of all time, and we are in urgent danger of failing to pass. Failure will mean the end of life, as we know it, on Planet Earth. Of course, so will success.There is a catch-22. We cannot design rites that will help us through this ultimate passage until after we have gone through it. But in this Mother of all rites of passage, we are on our own. No guides to the next level exist. The established religions have lost their authority and power. New religious movements may help a few people, but usually they are based on far too limited a vision of the Real, and easily become corrupted into egoic power trips.The lack of authentic and relevant rites of passage is an essential component of the rite of passage through which we are now struggling. We must begin our effort to understand our situation by recognizing that the world is a school for souls, and the dystopic scenario of a dying world is the final exam at our current level of consciousness. The exam itself is meant to raise our consciousness to the next level.We are now in the perilous passage between one kalpa and another, the end of one planetary cycle of time (Plato called it the Great Year, containing four seasons, or ages) and the beginning of the next. It is the moment in which humans must pass from ego-consciousness to an infinitely higher level and kind of consciousness that is so different from all that we can conceive symbolically that it has no name.In earlier times, we would have called it God-consciousness in some cultures, Buddha-consciousness, or Emptiness, or the Dao, in others. But because of our current splintered, materialist, nominally multi-religious, yet predominantly atheistic, social context, no single term resonates with accurate meaning for everyone, and those old terms from the axial age religious traditions carry too much obsolete baggage, and not enough reference to the interdimensional quantum world in which we now know we dwell.Perhaps the most common denominator for what we must attain would be liberated consciousness. This term comes out of the tradition of yoga. In Sanskrit, the term is jivan mukta, liberated while alive. But again, the term refers to the attainment of a new state, but it does not describe the ecstatic, luminous nature of that state. Similarly, we could speak of rapture, redemption, salvation, or beatitude—but all such words point to what must remain the Great Mystery until realized.When it is said that the world is a school, that implies that, as in any educational process, we are constantly facing tests, which are all either minor or major rites of passage. In this macrocosmic worldly school, we can recognize many different types of rites of passage.It is only at the social level that we entertain the illusion that we can design rites of passage for others. In traditional tribal societies, there were rites to recognize birth, naming, and reaching puberty, and along with the latter, came the conferring of the duties, expectations, and privileges that ensue upon entering adulthood. Of course, there were rites for all the other important life passages that grace the arc of our human existence, until the final funerary rites complete the program. In the tribal societies, the rite of passage into adulthood was an ordeal, a test of manhood for the males, and a preparation for motherhood for the females.Though we have lost the ancient communal coherence, we still retain some rites today, though usually in diluted or commercialized form. In fact, many types of recreational activity are felt to be rites of passage. Most Hollywood films, for example, are designed as vicarious rites of passage. People who want their own physical version of an ordeal can take ropes courses, or bungee jump, or parachute out of airplanes; some join fight clubs, or do other dangerous things to enact a socially acceptable, yet private rite of passage. Even going on a date can be a dangerous rite of passage these days.Some traditional rites of passage have become ersatz. The bar mitzvah rite obviously no longer brings a Jewish boy into manhood. Neither does the quinceañera, the celebration of the fifteenth birthday, popular in Hispanic cultures. Joining the army is a very serious rite of passage. But its intention is only to take one from childhood to a state of servile discipline, rigorous and physically challenging, but not by any means a vision quest or hero’s journey. The version of manhood one learns in an army is, alas, counterproductive to the attainment of higher consciousness.Moreover, since homosexual men, as well as women, are now allowed to serve openly in the military in many countries, the army’s own traditional concept of manhood has been blurred. Its macho meaning is that one is not-gay and not-feminine. But an army that normalizes those two forms of otherness creates anxiety in those who feel lacking in their manhood, and perhaps secretly unsure of their heterosexuality or even their gender. It is not that women or homosexual men should not be allowed to serve in armies (and yes, of course, in a healthy world, there would not be armies of any kind), but we must recognize that since we have deregulated our notions of manhood and womanhood in the West (which is one of the issues that anger and disgust many traditional non-Western cultures), our military rites of passage no longer function as they were originally designed. This creates yet more frustration and tension that threaten the functioning of those institutions.Those who seek higher rites, events of transformation that are more relevant to the need for opening consciousness to a level beyond the ego and its attendant ambivalences, will choose different sorts of adventures, including such major mind-altering rituals as drinking ayahuasca in the Peruvian jungle; or going on a long fast, perhaps in solitude; or one can choose to walk out alone into some unknown desolate territory, pursuing a vision quest in the desert. All these variants of the shamanic rite of passage may be effective to an extent. But usually they fail to bring about the aim of ego death and spiritual rebirth, the radical shift to a new octave of consciousness that the world now requires of us all.Some rites of passage are karmic. This type is unique to each of us, and by definition, beyond our control. A traumatic occurrence, such as an auto accident or an illness, can be a transformative event. Many people have reported undergoing non-ordinary karmic events such as near-death experiences that result in quantum shifts in consciousness. Alien abduction events are also in this category.Twelve great rites of passage are essential to the soul’s completion. Though inherent, our societies today are destroying the power of some of these rites of passage through the corruption of the integrity of both natural and spiritual conditions.Birth—the first great challenge. The pre-natal being must struggle alone through the birth canal and out into the world. Unfortunately, many women are taking that rite of passage away from the child by opting for delivery by medically unnecessary caesarian-section.School—the challenge of socialization. Nowadays, this happens too soon (by putting the child in daycare) because the parents have to work. And worse, the school systems today do not generally provide for the kind of character development that fosters healthy ego empowerment, and that encourages the ideal of development of higher consciousness that prepares one for attainment of the immortal Self.Puberty—the sexuation challenge. Because our society today is itself confused about appropriate sexual norms, gender identity, and the role of sexuality in spiritual development, people enter biological adulthood without resolving their confusions and anxieties about sex, and without the understanding of how to cultivate a love relationship of a more elevated and life-enhancing modality.Adult Identity Crisis—the challenge of choosing a life path. The current social system co-opts people into choosing a path without heart, simply in order to avoid unemployment. When the inevitable global financial crisis reaches its abyssal endpoint, resulting in social collapse, ordinary life will become impossible. Those who are still deciding whether to study in a university or have children should be aware that normal life patterns will soon end and emergency conditions will ensue. We should prepare prior to the cataclysm, not afterward.Philia—Higher Non-Dyadic Empathic Relationality—the development of true intersubjectivity, even interbeing. These are passages to ever-deeper levels of psycho-spiritual intimacy, sensitivity, and integrity. Our culture has snuffed out much of the desire for such deepening of our soulfulness, compassion, and capacity to sacrifice, as a result of valorizing only physical intimacy. The growth of friendships has been stunted. Many people no longer read serious literature, in which intersubjective relationships are explored and psychological maturity is modeled. Instead, young people are seduced into spending their time on superficial social networking sites, not to mention the pornographic websites that damage the development of the capacity for healthy intimacy in sexual relationships.The deepest human non-sexual relationships offered by this culture occur in the offices of psychoanalysts. But these relationships are only open to the few who can afford them, and who know how to make use of them. Depth psychology is still stigmatized as an endeavor only intended for those who are mentally ill. Indeed, most psychotherapists focus only on strengthening the ego, not on transcendence. Spiritual guides who can offer deeper levels of relationship, conferring recognition of the Self and who can engage in transformational dialogue that enables dropping of the ego are few and far between. The organized religious orders rarely train their priests, rabbis, roshis, mullahs, or swamis to emanate unconditional love nor to listen and respond in accurate attunement while participating in profound healing conversation. There is such a hunger for spiritual recognition that people will stand in long lines to get a hug from a motherly guru, or a smile from a reverend father. But such moments will not substitute for deep connection with someone who has gained profound wisdom, compassion, and interpersonal skill and is willing to attend deeply to your being while you struggle to sort out and express the inchoate feelings welling up in your heart. Having an ongoing relationship of that kind can produce many moments of exquisite self-discovery, functioning as a perpetual rite of passage, a liaison that can light up one’s life and accelerate spiritual development more than any other means.Mid-life Transformation Crisis—the challenge of shifting out of the horizontal arena of worldly labor, gratification seeking, and the politics of family engagement, into the vertical ascent to transcendent illumination and liberation. Our secular society does not recognize the soul’s yearning for ecstatic union with the Absolute and fails to support this passage. Yet, as social decomposition and demise approaches, this attainment becomes ever more essential.The Spiritual Summit—the challenge of dissolving ego into Self. To achieve fulfillment of the vertical dharma, we need to create more transformational communities, ashrams, wisdom schools, and spiritual retreat centers where people can come to complete their metamorphosis. We need to train more spiritual guides. Psychotherapy and conventional religion have failed to meet this need. Our culture has systematically destroyed its monasteries and spiritual communities and replaced them with casinos, theme parks, and other tourist traps. Most of the retreat centers that do exist cater to the beginner, the dilettante, and the seeker of the quick fix.The Journey Beyond—the challenge of facing bodily death. Traditional cultures offered training and guidance for the journey beyond mortal life. Texts such as the Book of the Dead (both the Egyptian and Tibetan versions) and other mystical literature offered maps and mantras for approaching the Great Light. Today, such guidance and blessing are either offered by religious clerics who know the standard prayers, but who have not died while alive, or else death is denied. The compelling need for inner preparation for death is not met by most hospitals and homes for the elderly. Most of us die without benefit of spiritual assistance.Self-mastery—the passage to becoming a spiritual teacher. This advanced rite of passage is only gained after much perseverance in the struggle to grow into greatness and gravitas, to cut all interest in childish things, or even in worldly adult pursuits, through disciplining the mind and body to such a refined level of accuracy, strength, tenderness, and dispassion, that the traces of egocentricity have utterly disappeared. For this, it is usually necessary, and certainly desirable, to enter into a serious apprenticeship with a master teacher, a relationship based on vows and virtue, surrender and absorption of an ocean of knowledge and immersion in an infinite love that leads one to the sacred heart of higher consciousness. It is such an unconditional relationship and rigorous training of the emotional intelligence and the power of empathic attunement that endows one with the skills to guide others to Self-realization. The yogic path generally involves a number of lesser rites of passage, beginning with initiation, proceeding through novitiate to full discipleship. Each advance entails a deepening of commitment, fuller acceptance of austerity, simplicity, transparency, and purity of life and mind. The inner dimension of the passage from student to teacher derives its authenticity from the attainment of sahaja samadhi, an ongoing and obvious state of grace, a presence that is filled with joy and generosity, a manner both desireless and fearless, an inner silence shining with undeniable divine illumination. The passing of the torch, the public recognition of attainment of the status of swami, spiritual master, is without importance and may even be refused. The reality of liberation is enough.From the Dreamtime to the Cosmic Dreamer—the passage beyond the holographic simulation we know as the cosmos to the controlling intelligence ensconced in the radiance of the Singularity. This cosmic rite occurs only at the cusp of planetary destruction, at the end of a kalpa, when the human species determines its destiny and each soul ascends in accord with the arc of its covenant with God. Some will take initiation into the cosmic community and travel to far off galaxies and inconceivable adventures. Some will enter into suspended animation until the school bell rings again for another earthly incarnation. Some will descend as avatars to guide a Golden Age. Some will ordain events from a higher dimension. Some will abide in the Supreme Liberation.Many people are aware of the presence of extraterrestrial beings on and around our planet. Some are here to assist in our evolution to the next level of interplanetary citizenship. Others have come to usurp our planetary real estate for their own purposes, since our species has abdicated its responsibility of stewardship of the living web of Nature. We will have to prove our spiritual worthiness to retain our right to rule over the affairs of Gaia. This is a subject of too great a scope to cover in an essay.There is a coterie of transhumanists who insist the future lies with artificial intelligence, and they may get the world they dream of. But not all desire to upload their persona into a personal computer and continue life in a titanium robotic body, perhaps to revel in a cyborg fling with a seductive sexbot in a virtual reality. Some would rather return to Nature, to commune with life forms not designed in laboratories but discovered in the Real, and to awaken super powers as shape-shifting shamans alive to the full thrill of unprogrammed potency and magical prowess.Transcendental Consummation—the passage to the Ultimate Beyond. A few ancient souls are ripened to the point of readiness for the paramount trans-cosmic rite of passage. The portal is opening to the Godhead. But the ego feels it is annihilation into Nothingness. To one who knows the truth, it is the passage to infinite eternal light, to total and absolute intelligence, to overwhelming beauty and unending bliss.Playing dice with God—the final game. All these types and levels of rites of passage are occurring simultaneously, because we have now entered into the vortex of the implicate order, the chaosmos that culminates creation, crowning consciousness with surreal sovereignty over the selection of the succeeding simulation.But before we are whisked through the wormhole of immeasurable imagination, into worlds inconceivable to the human range of reverie, we must accept the wager of indeterminacy, the carefree submission to the freefall of fate, rolling the dice of destiny with impeccable aplomb.Prepare, therefore, to be drawn into the whirlpool of hypnopompic pageantry to the alpha point of Aletheia, the most extraordinary rite of passage of all, under the spell of forgetfulness that arranges our entrée into another here and now. This passage remains forever unknown, as forgotten as Atlantis, with amnesia to its amnesia. The real Buddha does not know of Buddhahood, Christ is emptied of His glory, which is the true sign of His glory, and the fool enjoys a happiness that neither emperors nor magi ever taste. The Dao calls us all to surrender to the flow, to the mercy of the serendipitous, the ecstatic joyride through the Heart of the Great Mystery that is the Self. You cannot train for what you are about to encounter—the Mother of all rites of passage—yet still, you must prepare, to be reborn.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nDevolution of ConsciousnessHistory	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 22:05:55	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.401228	2025-10-28 15:31:24.401228	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The ego mind is wild, savage, selfish, filled with lusts, anger, greed, demands, judgments, hostile disregard for the feelings of others, it is utterly self-ungovernable—and yet at the same time it is weak, unbalanced, irrational, emotionally unstable, incapable of perseverance, humility, or clarity, or of full dedication and cooperation with others. Yogis refer to the ego-mind as the monkey-mind. The first task of a new yogi upon entering the path to the Supreme Liberation is gaining control of this monstrous monkey mind.The problem, of course, is that the newly minted yogi is still burdened with the monkey mind. How can a person achieve dedication to the goal of governing his own ungovernable mind? The monkey mind will not agree to its own taming. The answer lies in the fact that the monkey mind is not one’s entire consciousness. There is a margin of awareness that lies beyond the monkey mind. This marginal awareness must gain the strength to overcome the monkey by making an alliance with a spiritual guide who has gained such self-sovereignty. Through the development of a deep, trusting, candid relationship, centered upon the open exploration of the soul of the disciple, and a gathering recognition of the power of their bond of love to strengthen and stabilize the soul, the disciple will gradually internalize the power of spirit such a guide transmits. This will create and augment an inner center of legitimate authority that can step-by-step further the process of disciplining and elevating the monkey mind to finally recognize its true divinity.In Indian mythology, the divinized monkey mind is personified in Hanuman. The monkey god Hanuman served Rama, the avatar of the Supreme Being, in the great war to free the soul, His beloved Sita, from the clutches of the devil, the many-headed Ravana, and his army of demons. This eternally relevant epic, the Ramayana, tells the deep story that is being lived out in all of us every day of our lives. The more consciously aware one becomes of the playing out of this archetypal project in one’s own soul, the more easily one will gain power over the demons that torment us.The first step in gaining victory in this most intimate and ultimate conflict is to become a disciple of a living spiritual path, a path with a living guide who can help you overcome the obstacles that will inevitably arise once you throw down the gauntlet to Maya. The more one can use one’s margin of awareness to bond with the teacher, to accept guidance and advice that comes from a clearer mind, one that has your highest good as goal and holds your well-being as a sacred trust, the more effectively one will be able to defy the monkey mind and carry out the mandates of the Supreme Self.Becoming a disciple means that one dedicates oneself to the spiritual disciplines, the sadhanas, which will lead to sovereignty over the monkey mind. The first discipline to undertake is daily meditation. By using all one’s free will to gain a sattvic, meditative serenity, one can gradually overcome the tendency of the monkey mind to passive refusal through tamasic inertia and sleep, as well as its active resistance through rajasic hyperactivity, including the hyperactive fury of the traumatized mind. Once the regimen of regular meditation sittings every day, morning and evening, has been put in place, one will have taken the most important step in curbing the excesses of the monkey mind, and of soothing its anguish and pain.Fulfilling all the other disciplines, the yamas and niyamas, is the next major victory that must be gained. This means the perseverance in spiritual study, the vowing not to act out, not to flee, not to run away from oneself, and engaging in the steady, gradual, but ever more profound purification of one’s behavior, then one’s thoughts, and finally the unconscious phantasies of the ego mind. In time, one’s life will have become a work of art, one’s attitudes will have become noble, one’s thoughts sublime. One will naturally live one’s life in blessed simplicity, in inward realization of the Divine Presence. One’s consciousness will have become one-pointed, whole-hearted, silent, solitary, and free. This is the transformation from monkey mind to monk. The true monk, whether living in a monastery (or ashram) or out in the kali yuga chaos, whether single or married, will be a beacon of light and peace to the suffering world. The true monk is a bodhisattva, a benevolent bringer of salvation to all the lost souls who seek release from their torments.In this conversion to monk-hood, the yogi renounces the last traces of ego-mind, and in the effortless action, the karma yoga, of divine service, of functioning as a conduit of healing energy, wisdom, spiritual power, and the ongoing humble life of servant leadership, the purification process will attain its fullness. Consciousness will have become the temple of the Supreme Being. Ego will have died. The kingdom of Heaven will have come to fruition within. This is the final transformation from monk to monarch. The divine inner monarchy is not ruled by an ego, but rather, by the Absolute Emptiness that the ego will have become—an Emptiness that is filled by the Presence of God.This is the fulfillment of our purpose on Earth, and the beginning of the return to divine life for our entire planetary consciousness, the whole collective life of Nature. All depends on humans once more playing the role of containing and radiating the Supreme Light that unites us all in love, in joy, in the bliss of our eternal Essence. Let us give all of Creation the ultimate blessing of Supreme Liberation. Our suffering world cannot wait. It calls out for healing love. Our world is our Self. Will you not sacrifice your monkey mind to save your world, to save your soul? This is the question that haunts everyone’s conscience. I wish you blessings on finding the answer that will set us all free.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMythologyOvercoming ObstaclesYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 20:53:52	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.422304	2025-10-28 15:31:24.422304	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is the greatest honor and privilege a human being can attain. This is because an ashram is the most sacred archetypal form of community. An ashram is a chrysalis in which humans can transform into gods. An ashram is the intentional creation of a sacred space in which the ego is transcended.All ashram residents become midwives of spiritual rebirth for unlimited numbers of souls. An ashram is an avatar factory, a human butterfly farm, a spawning ground for angels.To have the opportunity to live in an ashram means that one dwells constantly in the highest possible energy field of the Divine Presence, in the bliss of the Supreme Love. To live in a true ashram—one that is fulfilling its mission of multiplying manifestations of liberated cosmic awareness—is to be empowered to attain the greatest actualization of the infinite potential of Spirit. This kind of opportunity is granted not even once in a lifetime, but once in a whole cycle of lifetimes. It represents the moment of graduation from the wheel of karma.The archetype of the ashram is trans-cultural and trans-temporal. It has been the utopian longing of every profound thinker and saint of every age and civilization. But the world has an ambivalent relationship to the idea of the ashram. This is because the ashram, being the ultimate instrument of human liberation, is perceived by the ego as the enemy of its false power.The nemesis of fascism is not Marxism, but monasticism. The monastery is likewise the enemy of Stalinism, of corrupt monarchy, and of tyranny of every kind. Christ and the early Christians were divine communists. No one owned anything privately, all was held in common. Everyone served God and worked for the good of all. What has kept the Church alive during all these centuries is not the ostentation of the Vatican, the hierarchy of cardinals, archbishops, and the rest. The heart of the Church is its monasteries and convents. The simple monastic way of living alone remains true to the ideals of the teachings of Christ. The core of Christian love is expressed in its purest form by its greatest saints, who are also the founders of its varied monastic orders, from the original desert fathers and mothers to Evagrius Ponticus, John Cassian, Benedict of Nursia, Francis of Assisi, and others who have, again and again, brought the Church back from the corruption it has been prone to, and immersed it once more in the divine heart expressed in the sacred injunctions to poverty, chastity, and humility.This same teaching of blessed simplicity, to borrow a term from Raimundo Panikkar, and complete surrender to God, has motivated yogis since long before the advent of Christianity. In fact, Christianity can truly be considered the continuation of the yogic tradition. Before the Christian moment there were the Essenes. And before that, in the East, were all the various forms of yoga—Taoist yoga in China, Buddhist yoga throughout India, Tibet, and southeast Asia—and of course the yogic lineages of the Adi Sanatana Dharma, now known in degraded form as Hinduism, that have remained unbroken throughout history. Now all the lineages and religions are exhausted, corrupted, and confused. The esoteric core has gone dead in each one. Dharma is all but finished. The human spirit has yielded to the pornography of power, sex, greed, enslavement of the multitudes, held down by sadistic oppression, high-tech surveillance, and the demonic activity of death squads. The system is now failing, leading its managers to ever more desperate measures to maintain control. We are accelerating toward the long-prophesied apocalyptic climax to human history.At this moment, the reappearance of the humble ashram is the antidote, the ark that can weather the coming flood, and the ferryboat that can take us to the yonder shore of both history and reality. An ashram can transfer us from the phenomenal to the noumenal, from the limited to the unlimited. The ashram, with all its implications for transcendence of the false self, is our passport to becoming true citizens of the cosmos. It is the gateway to a new and miraculous dreamland.An ashram is a place for the practice of yoga—union with God. It is both a community and a lifestyle of contemplative freedom. Life in an ashram maximizes our opportunity to achieve Jivan Mukti, liberation while alive. Liberation means our realization that we are the Supreme Reality, the cosmic consciousness Itself, not simply an individual manifestation of that Intelligence, but the One Without a Second. This ultimate realization is the priceless goal of life. Without achieving the complete recognition of our oneness with the Absolute, as the Absolute, and the fullness of grace, joy, love, knowledge, and power that such realization confers, we shall not have completed our work here in the phenomenal plane, and must continue bound to the wheel of rebirth.Most importantly, the creation of an ashram is not the work of human beings, but of God, directly intervening in the affairs of men. What each of us can do is join our individual forces to the work of the highest love, and be rewarded by the synergy that surpasses understanding. We shall all be astonished at how the Cosmic Self brings together those who are necessary for the building of our temple to serve the most holy agenda of universal peace.As Kali Yuga winds down to its dreadful and ignominious demise, other lifestyles are becoming less and less attractive. Life in any city in the world is now a hell realm of pollution, crime, plagues, unruly crowds, traffic jams, noise, and perpetual vexation. And living alone in the country, or with only one’s nuclear family, poses other problems for long-term survival. Only a stable community located in optimal natural surroundings, and organized around the Supreme Principle, can prevail once the grid of civilization has gone down. We must build such communities of love, trust, and faith now. There is no time to waste.A true ashram does not serve any particular religion, racial or ethnic group, age, gender, or other identitarian limit. It must be open to all. It recognizes the validity of all paths, of all names of God, of all approaches to the One who is beyond name and form. An ashram does not support empty ritual, but rather encourages facing the naked truth of our innermost Being and, to use a term of Thich Nhat Hanh, our Interbeing. We must develop and refine our capacity for Interbeing, for intersubjectivity, for empathy, caring, compassion, in other words, for pure communion. Only in a true ashram environment can we grow up to become as gods, our destiny that has been foretold and must now be lived.An ashram should be located in a pure environment, where its residents can feel oneness with all of Nature as a cosmic expression of the Supreme Intelligence. An ashram gives us the opportunity to live in harmony with Nature, to commune with nourishing and healing plants, with animals, with the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and the elements. It is a sacred place where we can hear the running water of the stream, watch the clouds move across the horizon, where we can feel the breeze on our face, where we can get our hands dirty in the garden, and bathe in the river. It is a place of solitude and deep meditation. And it is a place of togetherness, of song, of breaking bread together as a united family enjoying the glory of fully conscious existence.Ashram life, with the consistent flow of regular hours for meditation, for study, for solitary walks in Nature, for the practice of arts and crafts, for gardening and maintenance of the ashram, for discussion of ashram affairs among the sangha members, and for classes and seminars and individual counseling sessions to accelerate spiritual growth. The ashram schedule gives its residents a healthy structure on which to build our lives. It offers the optimal distance between members that protects each other’s solitude yet heightens the level of spiritual intimacy. Life becomes enriched to the utmost.The opportunity to build an ashram is a unique and sacred task, offered to those who are prepared to transcend the illusions of the ego and live in the truth of our oneness. All are called, but few shall choose to respond. Even though it is the deepest heart’s desire of everyone, few have the strength to say No to the seductions of the ego, and Yes to the purity of Spirit. Those few are the most fortunate of beings. You have chosen to graduate from the school of suffering and enter the school of bliss. You have chosen to be the founders of a new age, a new world, to reach a new summit of human achievement. May you be blessed with the courage to carry through your true heart’s desire, and attain the One Self. May the Sat Yoga Ashram become the temple in which your joyous enlightenment is eternally consecrated.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nAshram Life	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 20:37:22	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.426316	2025-10-28 15:31:24.426316	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This disruptive process is accelerating exponentially. The factors involved are well known. They include alienation, cynicism, and collective paranoid psychosis, exemplified by the irrational social overreactions to the fear of terrorism. More profound factors include the loss of values and role models of sublime nobility or generosity of spirit. We have also suffered the loss of true communication in the deluge of data streams and technological apparatuses that interrupt, rather than summate, lines of thought leading to wisdom and genuine rapport.There has, in short, been a collective loss of soul in the human species. This could be considered the meaning of the postmodern. The loss of soul follows a previous loss of spirit that brought about modernization in the first place. The loss of both these dimensions of human reality remains unnoticed by the collective discourse. That discourse has become too dumbed-down to even be able to conceptualize, let alone grieve, such losses.The continuing deformation of human character outpaces the capacity of the field of psychology to describe or understand its dynamics. Diagnostic manuals become obsolete before they can be published. The only field even endeavoring to keep up with the shifting psychic sands of human consciousness is that of psychoanalysis. But that field has become mired in its own battles with the establishment for legitimacy, resulting in compromises with the psychiatric preference for neurological explanations and the pharmaceutical industry’s preference for pill-pushing, rather than the offering of insight and understanding, let alone transformation. Moreover, psychoanalysis, like Freud’s role model, Moses, stops before the promised land of superconscious presence, and thus can never guide patients beyond the threshold of neurosis to the real inner peace that passeth understanding.The twin loci of the deformation of human character are the devastating rushes of the energy known as anxiety, and the black hole of depression. In fact, one can be the defense against the other. But they intertwine like snakes, a negative kundalini complex constituting what Lacan calls the death drive. These snakes are extremely intelligent, far more so than the conscious mind of the human ego. Therefore, few spiritual warriors these days succeed in slaying their inner demons. Usually, the demons are the ones who win. This is because the main weapons to defeat those demons were forged several thousand years ago, by such heroic figures as Buddha, Mahavira, Shankara, Socrates, and St. Paul. But those weapons are now out of date. The snake demons are far more powerful than they were in those days. And the modern weapons of psychoanalysis, gestalt therapy, family systems therapies, the touchy-feely new age therapies, and all the others currently out there are helpless against these now-monstrous demons. The serpents of psychopathology cannot be defeated any longer by such puny means.It must also be kept in mind that there is an ongoing arms race between the demons and the helping professions. Just as bacteria gradually gain immunity from the lethal effects of each new class of drugs and to overcome all the developments of science, in the same way, the negative kundalini complex learns to overcome the power of prozac and paxil, and to force the employment of larger and larger doses of more and more dangerous chemicals, which produce side-effects worse than the symptoms they were designed to treat. The negative complex also learns the conceptual basis of psychoanalytic treatment, as well as those of other therapies, and soon can sidestep and outwit even the most masterful therapists.The nagas of negativity can always confound the effort to understand them. They are not limited to any logic of sense, because they are reacting against, and feeding upon, the very structure of reason itself. They frolic in the frustrations of their would-be rescuers and conquerors. The archetype of terrorism lies here, in the black hole of the soul, where no light reaches. And no mind fighting in the trenches of duality can successfully launch an assault upon the bastions of the psychopathic demons, if only because the horrific ghouls are phantoms. They are non-local phenomena. They are shape-shifters, because they have no essence. They are form without substance, signifiers without signifieds. They are floating fields of nightmare, tremors of unmoored memory lit up by bolts of phantasmatic fright. These are traumas that have never been lived, except in bardo states. They cannot be healed by any reworking of history, nor by any cognitive reassessment of values. Reality itself is in dispute. Nor can any criteria claim sanctity or even power of persuasion.There can no longer be symbolic rapport between individuals, now that the social imaginary has cracked so utterly. The loss of social coherence and vertical connection between the Self and the ego has produced a systemic failure of the capacity of discourse to transmit prana between souls. Love has no channel through which to flow into the phenomenal plane. The access to the Source has been cut off. The Real no longer nourishes the symbolic plane, and so the symbolic has no power to prevent the distortion of the imaginary. Thus, there is no operative counterforce of life and creativity to the sinister strangling forces of perversion and death.All that is left as a possibility to sustain life is the creation of a superorganism acting as the instrument of divine love and wisdom. This must take the form of a spiritual community in which all members have surrendered their separate egos into the sacrificial fire of unity. Such an achievement alone can muster the spiritual power necessary to dissolve the negativity festering in the world. An uncanny supramental energy field, one that cannot be identified with any particular bodily being, one that is present in the eternity of the Absolute, can alone have the strength to swallow a black hole and live.Such a force of Goodness, transmitting the power of divine intelligence, can open the portals of super-potentiality in the human minds that are attuned and surrendered to that Presence. This alone can function as a path to human survival. But it is a survival that requires the death of the human ego in its current form, and a radical evolutionary rebirth as Life itself. We must sacrifice the private life of the ego that is depriving us of life as creatures of Nature, to regain the power of Life as the Creative Source from which Nature can be reborn in the image of the One.The goal is clear: a renaissance of human community, and through the collective gaze of the Divine Other, the incubation of the True Self in every member of such a mutually empowering transformational society. The difficulty is in visualizing how such a community can crystallize itself into existence. Like any bacterial culture, at least one purified soul is required to tirelessly radiate the essence of presence in a silent transmission of awakening to all who are open to shifting into a higher reality.Wisdom must integrate perfectly with the power of love to birth a process of metabolizing the latent psychic energies of the Atman into the concretized consciousness of the ego, thus granting the power to digest and assimilate the repressed traumas stewing in the subconscious realm. The growth of the ego-consciousness has been held in check by the primal fear of emptiness. It has preferred to create and maintain traumatic phantasies to structure its psychic space, rather than to deal with the fact of Nothingness. The psychic snakes of negativity have been nourished on this fear. The ego mind feels that anxiety and depression are preferable to emptiness.Coming to face the Real of Absolute Nothingness is the essential step in Self-Liberation. In this recognition, the ego, which is also naught but a fantasy, dissolves. What then comes to permeate awareness is the Supreme Presence of Pure Emptiness. And the duality of emptiness and form also dissolves into the wholeness of the One that is Zero. This realization constitutes Awakening, which is psychologically contagious. A spiritual fermentation process will soon be underway in any group in which two or more have authentically realized the Absolute.Once the culture begins fermenting, the process accelerates rapidly. Unpredictable potentialities emerge spontaneously, leading to new forms of crystalline interbeingness that have never existed before. Many unprecedented kinds of spiritual community are, indeed, now forming around the world. Some will fail, others will continue to grow and evolve. We are in the midst of a planetary evolutionary process that no individual can control or even comprehend. Only complete surrender to the supreme “One who knows,” resulting in a direct intuition that transcends conceptualization, can create the linkage with the Cosmic Mind that constitutes the meaning of Avatar. And only the gathering of Avatars worldwide into an active superorganism—a kind of spiritual globalization that will be the inverse of the present globalization of corporate structures—could override the current force of negativity impelling contemporary events to their climactic—and climatic—doom.The rebirth of divine consciousness is in process already. No power on Earth can resist it. The time to surrender is now.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nDevolution of ConsciousnessEgo Structure	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:35:14	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.432563	2025-10-28 15:31:24.432563	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Love is our innermost essence, our nature, and our fulfillment. But the love that is the very life energy of our Being is occluded by the false consciousness that developed in childhood and which has been petrified by unconscious conflicts, adaptation to social norms, and entrancement by ideologically determined limitations of our horizons. To free our minds from such constraints and open our intellects and hearts to our vast untapped potential, as individuals and as a united community of God-realized beings, is the focus of aspiration of the great work of self-transformation.We have the potential to create a harmonious world, to apply our intelligence to the solution of all the current problems the world is facing. The obstacle is the human ego. The ego in its current dominant form represents a failure of humanity to grow to our ultimate stage of psycho-spiritual maturity. That failure must now be rectified. This is our transformational imperative.Human consciousness is a spectrum of potentiality. Except for a rare few sages and saints, we have not as a species attained the upper end of the spectrum. We must do so now, and create thereby a shift in the planetary noetic field of collective consciousness. To accomplish this goal, we must understand the situation and have the courage, truthfulness, knowledge, skill, and humility to accomplish the transcendence of the ego.At the most primitive end of the spectrum of ego consciousness, we manifest as frightened and withdrawn, needy, helpless, and infantile, while at the same time, we come across as furious, greedy, possessive, domineering, and ruthless tyrants. This combination of fear and anger leads to the controlling and invasive, yet also flighty, ambivalent, and non-committal attributes of the ego, making it insufferable in its relationships with others. At the collective level, this leads to a world of collective psychosis and sadistic narcissism, of wars, oppression, and uncontrolled destructiveness.But at the upper end of the spectrum of our potential, merely awaiting our realization, lie the healing powers of divine love, wisdom, creativity, and synergy. What those powers can accomplish when they are unleashed by a significant number of liberated beings is unimaginable to most people today. This is the wonder that the world is waiting to witness.But we must volunteer to be more than just witnesses, but active participants in the greatest evolutionary experiment ever undertaken. How to sign up to be part of this? Very simple: just shed your fears and your egoic defense mechanisms, surrender your life to the service of God and the realization of the true Self. Live without greed, self-pity, arrogance and egocentricity. Renounce the desire to dominate others, or to view others as sex objects or as means to any sort of egoistic end.We must also let go of the fear of being exploited, abused, or abandoned by others. This can only occur if we feel the loving presence of God within or encompassing us in light; the emptiness of egolessness; and the inner silence of buddhahood. By seeing all beings as manifestations of the one Supreme Being, and experiencing the oneness behind apparent diversity, the absolute nothingness that manifests as all appearances in the phenomenal world, the cosmic intelligence and love that is the cause of the universe, we can let go of the fear of loss, the fear of death, the fear of suffering.There is only one protection for any of us. It is not money, nor guns, nor barbed wire-encrusted gated ghettoes. Our only safety lies in surrender to the ultimate Power that has brought the entire universe into being. That power is nothing other than the Self. Through the purification of our capacity to love, the Self will emerge in all Her divine glory.The test of human love is the creation of a harmonious and purposeful transformational community. Let us be inspired by the vision of our divine potential, and organize into a global network of well-functioning transformational societies to bring the next age of higher consciousness into manifestation. The time to act is now. The Power of Love is invincible.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nLove	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:30:24	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.435046	2025-10-28 15:31:24.435046	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Where they differ is in their conceptions of power. There are many different ways to understand the nature of power and the source of power-and most importantly, in how to reach the underlying goal of possessing real power.Many forms of power are illusory. In the world today, we are witnessing a major devolution of power. The old forms of power are dissolving, many apparent power centers are being unmasked as false fronts, or divided within themselves and therefore powerless, and in general, people are discovering that when they get what they thought would be a sense of power it turns out to have been a mirage.We need to develop a unified field theory of power. Today, because of the fragmentation of the disciplines of scientific knowledge, there are many different theories of power that have not been integrated. The lack of coherence regarding the understanding of power has been a major block in the attainment of power. To a physicist, power means something very specific. To a politician, power means something else; while to a sociologist or culture theorist, something different from that. To a corporation director, it means something else again. To a military general, it has still another meaning; to a historian, yet another. And to a psychologist, power is understood in yet other terms.To a Sat Yogi, a scientist of ultimate reality, all the above-named approaches to an adequate concept of power are limited. They must be integrated, synthesized, and transcended through a far more inclusive understanding that takes into consideration the widest conceptions of the nature of the real. If we do not factor into our search for power a deep understanding of the nature and potentialities of consciousness, of the relationship of psychic energy to physical energy, of the being of the intelligence that operates the forces of physical Nature, and that maintains the matrix of space and time, then our conception of power can only be a bad joke, a petty psychotic delusion. This is the unfortunate situation that many of the most seemingly powerful and power-hungry individuals and institutions are in today. It results in the instantiation of a karmic law: the more power of an illusory kind that is amassed, the more real power slips away.Let us begin our understanding of the process of gaining real power with the following hypothesis: real power is good. The more real power we have, the better off we are. In the classical societies that preceded ours, this was openly accepted. The Supreme Being was recognized as being both All-Powerful and the Highest Good. But a break occurred with the advent of Christianity. Unlike the Old Testament God, who gained victory for Moses and the Israelites, enabling their liberation from Egypt and the conquest of the Promised Land, the God of Christ did not save His son from death on the cross. God was seen as no longer having that kind of power.Church historians would say, of course, that we must take a longer view of the match: though the Romans killed the personal body of Christ, in the next round it was Christianity that took over the Roman Empire. And if the real battlefield of power is the collective field of human consciousness, then what shifted in the triumph of Christianity was a formal recognition that the power of love is in the end greater than the power of brute force.But the match was still not over. The power of brute force has made a terrific comeback. The recognition of the power of love has again gone into eclipse, perhaps more deeply obscured than in the time of Jesus. When non-violent Buddhist monks petitioning for economic justice and political freedom are mowed down by a military regime in Myanmar, this becomes another object lesson in the nature of power.Have the teachings of the world’s religions been in vain? Are they a wishful delusion? Was Mao right that power comes from the barrel of a gun? If so, civilization is doomed. We shall destroy ourselves as a species and then no one shall have power. The suicidal logic of brute force has been revealed with utter concreteness in this historic moment when the major military establishments have their nuclear triggers cocked and ready for the final Armageddon that will eliminate from the face of the Earth all the current contestants for power. But the implications of this fact have not yet sunk deeply into human consciousness.Let us return to the individual level of the analysis. Parents who have the responsibility of raising children generally understand that their job is to encourage the development of real power in the child. This is the purpose of education in general. On the psychological level, we know that real power is a function of self-control. Beginning with the attainment of control over excretory functions and motor capacities of the body, the growing child develops gradually more control over mental and emotional impulses. The ability to delay gratification, to concentrate the mind, to think abstractly, to visualize future goals, to strategize, to refine concepts, to understand other people, to engage in mutually beneficial relationships, all these abilities increase the individual’s real power. At some point, the child consciously recognizes itself at a crossroad. The child can either indulge in fantasies of power or engage in the pursuit of real power, in which case its fantasies are put to use in a sublimated modality, and its desires are attained at a more mature and realistic level. The sacrifice of the illusory omnipotence of the infantile ego results in a gain at the level of real power.However, if the understanding of power remains at the level of the desire for domination (often out of the fear of being dominated by others), then the growth of real power remains stunted. Just as some people never grow out of the illusion that power is a function of weakness, and therefore they seek to dominate others through helplessness and/or feeling victimized and guilt-tripping the people who are psychologically enmeshed with them; and others never outgrow the wish to be the object of desire for those they consider to be wielders of power, in order to seduce that power away from them; in the same way, the majority get stuck in the illusion that through rising in some social hierarchy (which may range from a couple or family system to a neighborhood gang to a sports team to a corporation or government), they will attain the holy grail of ultimate power. This immature conception of the nature of power-and of reality-results in an immature culture that promotes the very suicidal logic that is now subverting the potential of our species to survive.The wager of a Sat Yogi is that another kind of power is possible to attain, through disciplined experimentation and inner transformation, one that has the capacity to alter the destiny of our planet and enable the restoration of our devastated environment. This is a kind of power that both Buddha and Christ were alluding to in their teachings, but which can be fleshed out more scientifically today, thanks to advances in the many contemporary fields of knowledge. It is indeed the eternal power of love, but also it involves much more than that: the power of wisdom that can harness the forces of Nature, and of the very matrix of time and space, in fact, the power to download and merge with the intelligence that is the creator of our entire universe. This is real power.It is beyond the scope of this essay to explain the entire experimental protocol and paradigm of Sat Yoga. Suffice it to say that the power sought by a sat yogi is a continuation of the power search that starts the ego on its way through the world-beginning with a mastery of cultural meanings, through wide reading and encounters with the arts, the disciplines of every field of research, meetings with living intellectuals and masters of literature, music, philosophy, and inner development.As the individual grows in real power, there is a concomitant humbling of the ego-a realization of how little one knows and can accomplish as an individual, and how vast the universes, both the physical and the symbolic. As real power and psychological security and self-esteem develop to the maximum, there is an increasing awareness of an even higher universe, beyond the grasp of the symbolic intelligence of the egoic mind. One realizes that every new stage of growth requires a sacrifice of the power gained at a lower stage. At some point, the individual recognizes the need to jettison the ego itself as an organizing principle, in order to ascend to the higher levels.One likewise sees all too clearly that those who have remained stuck at the lower understanding of power as domination, egoic prestige, an abundance of sexual conquests and material possessions, may gain their dreams of greatness, but even then they are miserable. To the ego, no amount of money is enough. No amount of fame or status is sufficient. And the higher one climbs that fool’s hill, the more enemies one makes, the harder becomes one’s heart, the less rewarding are the rewards. Material success proves barren, ultimately pointless. One recognizes finally that one had merely been running away from oneself, living in a fantasy world to avoid the awareness of aging and mortality, the ego’s impotence and sense of lack-in other words, living an inauthentic existence. And in the obsession to gain the delusions of power one has lost the only important things in life: real love, friendship, wisdom, the experience of life’s sacred dimensions, the presence of God within.There is always blowback from the efforts to gain egoic power. That is the law of karma. Because the ego is only a partial and contingent reality, its power is always at the expense of the whole. And therefore the whole will never permit egoic power to expand beyond an acceptable limit. Uncontrolled ego power is equivalent to a cancer in the body politic of the planetary consciousness. The cancer must be removed. The collective consciousness has antibodies to rid itself of cancerous cells, but if the cancer escapes detection for too long a period and grows beyond the power of the antibodies to destroy it, then the cancer will metastasize until it destroys the entire body. That is now occurring in the collective body of the human species. The problem cannot be solved at a political level. We must gain a new kind of power.It is becoming increasingly apparent that the entire system of power relationships at every level is now breaking down. One byproduct of this chaos in human affairs is the breakdown of order in Nature as well. Global heating is causing a rise in sea levels that will destroy many of the world’s great cities, as has already happened to New Orleans. The massive growth in the size and frequency of hurricanes, tornadoes, and other cataclysmic geophysical phenomena, including earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, drought, and infectious diseases are also no coincidence, but a strong message coming from Nature of the karmic blowback that is only beginning.Those who have awakened to this situation will seek a way out, but all ways out are blocked but one. The only exit is inward and upward. We must gain the higher ground of elevated consciousness. That is the way of Sat Yoga. We must begin by worshipping real power: the power of the Absolute. Unless we sacrifice all lesser forms of power to the one real power, our garden planet is doomed. And since taking care of this planet was and remains our karmic responsibility, we cannot absolve ourselves of the effort to save her from our own predations, to save the beauty of the natural world that was given to us as a gift and that we have ruined with our greed and arrogance. Only through unconditional surrender to the one real power, to the point of becoming willing instruments of that power, egoless servants of the real God, can our desired destiny be fulfilled.We must learn again to worship Power. We must worship the true Power, not the false powers, and we must worship the one Power with all our heart, mind, and will. The final showdown between the one real power and all the false powers is about to begin. Every one of us must choose which side we are on. The blessing spoken repeatedly by the Jedi Knights in the film series Star Wars had it backwards. We should not pray, ‘May the Force be with you,’ but rather, ‘May you be with the Force.’ The Power is indeed within all of us. But we must choose to be loyal to the Power of God, rather than to the seductions of the ego.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming Obstacles	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:27:12	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.437169	2025-10-28 15:31:24.437169	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Rather than bringing about a lack of will to live, which is often how the ego feels—indeed many egos have a wish not to live, if not an active suicidal drive—the reborn Self will be filled with joyous energy, fully empowered, liberated from the weight of negative emotions, flying in the upper reaches of angelic intelligence, engaged in creative projects for the well-being and salvation of our besieged planet.Those who imagine that ego death means sitting around aimlessly do not grasp the reality of the Supreme Being. Once the ego surrenders to the Absolute Intelligence of the Self, life really begins. What dies is the bundle of egoic attributes that usually include confusion, apathy, aggressivity, anxiety, misery, and other forms of selfish pettiness. After the ego surrenders to God, one accepts life on its own terms and acts from genuine joy, love, hope, faith, and a boundless appetite for being an instrument of salvation for all beings. In the Buddhist tradition, this is known as functioning as a bodhisattva.There is no feeling of deadness in one who has passed through the sacred process of ego death and rebirth, but an exquisite aliveness that the ego cannot understand. This is because the ego is a fictional tissue of identifications designed and installed with the purpose of adapting to others, getting approval, manipulating people and situations, gaining power over others, and wallowing in such pathological pleasures as revenge, debasement, and even destruction of others who are perceived as enemies. These unpleasant aspects of the human ego are what require its death and rebirth.Of course, some egos are healthier than others. Some egos function as pillars of society and use their powers for good. They may be quite ethical, appreciative of higher values, of beauty, of the importance of taking care of the natural environment, and they may even be religious. What is the difference between a good ego that functions in a highly principled, idealistic, and adaptive manner and one who has undergone ego death and rebirth?The difference can be understood only if one grasps the structure of the ego. The ego is split. Its will is not single, whole, and integrated, but multiple, dispersed, fractured; and its mind is utterly uncontrollable by its own conscious center. The conscious subject does not know what is actually going on in its own subconscious regions. The conscious part of the ego is not in control of the ego’s real agendas. The conscious part of the ego is usually not even aware of the axioms, fantasies, traces of trauma, oedipal wishes, and superego commands that operate constantly from below the horizon of the cognitive and conative jurisdiction of the consciousness. That is why the ego can be said to be in a condition of false consciousness. Even when that false consciousness functions for the ostensible betterment of the world, it is operating within a larger command system that limits its effectiveness. Moreover, the unconscious operating system yields such fruits as anxiety and other emotional residues, such that one is generally in a state of suffering rather than in rapture.The ego may know exceptional moments of joy, but they are usually situation-governed. One may, for example, transcend the ego during peak experiences, perhaps moments in beautiful natural settings, like watching a sunset on a beach, or while running a marathon, or taking drugs or alcohol, or while involved in sexual intercourse. But these will not last, and some will have negative consequences. But joy in simply being eludes even the most principled and idealistic egoic identity. The pull of its inevitable attachments is always sabotaging its ability to remain present and serene.The death of the ego means the death of deadness; the death of suffering; the death of moral, psychological, aesthetic, and spiritual blindness; the death of fear and anxiety. The death of ego implies oneness with LIFE.Of course, bringing about the demise of the ego is not always an easy matter. That is why the science of Sat Yoga has developed a battery of techniques to help in achieving this end. Through the increase of awareness and understanding, the disabling of outmoded defense mechanisms, the lifting of repressions, and the input of shakti—those glowing flows of spiritual energy that are transmitted from the Source, both directly and via illumined teachers and communities of compassionate, evolving souls. Through wholehearted discipleship and devoted practice, the grace of egoless presence soon appears as the ultimate miracle of Being.As the Bible asks us, what good is it to gain the whole world if you lose your soul? The ego is the condition of soul loss. The death of the ego is the regaining of soul—in fact of the divine spirit that transcends even the realm of soul—and the gateway to reunion with the Absolute. Only if enough of us are willing to achieve the inner transformation that enables us to be manifestations of the One Without a Second will our planetary home have a second chance to flourish as a Paradise. Let us take refuge in the Heart, the One Self, let us create a pure world of loving oneness, and live together once more in the power and the grace of the Transfinite Self, in wisdom, in light, in innocence and playfulness. This is our highest calling and our true destiny.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:22:54	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.439961	2025-10-28 15:31:24.439961	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Human beings, alone of all creatures, have the power of re-designing our own psychic structure in the direction of ethical, aesthetic, cognitive, and spiritual perfection. Through the practice of Sat Yoga, we can gain the skills to alter our personalities, to align our psyche with our innermost essence, and to manifest, cultivate, and sustain the full flowering of the Godseed that lies latent within us all. The inherent powers that become activated in the event of such a self-transformation have tremendous effects upon the phenomenal plane, not only on the social and political levels, but also on the ecological and the geological. This is because gross matter responds to the vibrational transmissions of the subtle energy field of human consciousness. This little understood aspect of reality is the key to responding to the challenge of global warming as well as all the other challenges faced by humanity today. But to accomplish this, we must bring the power of the highest frequencies of our vibrational potential—we can call it Tao or Shiva, Emptiness, unitive awareness, Buddha-consciousness, or God-consciousness—into the equation as the essential engine of our will. Nothing less could suffice.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	Sat Yoga is the ancient science of metabolizing our theomorphic potential.

But to accomplish this, we must bring the power of the highest frequencies of our vibrational potential—we can call it Tao or Shiva, Emptiness, unitive awareness, Buddha-consciousness, or God-consciousness—into the equation as the essential engine of our will. Nothing less could suffice.To be theomorphic implies that we humans have the inherent, though currently mostly latent, ability to function as godlike beings. From ancient days, this has been the wager of Sat Yoga in all its forms—from Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist yogas in the East, to Hermetic, alchemical, kabbalistic, masonic, and all the other branches of yogic esoterism in the West. Yogis of every stripe have always recognized that the full spectrum of potential consciousness is available to us. Humans can range from the divine to the demonic. But once we drop below a certain point of integrity, we lose the free will to change course. At a given moment, decline becomes fall. Destruction becomes inevitable.Today, human culture has, as we all know only too well, taken a drastic turn toward the demonic. We have created a negative, bloodthirsty, and dumbed-down culture that valorizes selfishness, brutality, materialism, ruthlessness, prejudice, narcissism, apathy, unbridled masturbatory sensuality, irresponsibility, ignorance, bigotry, and paranoia. Unless we transform the culture, humanity is lost. In fact, most of us are already in the category of lost souls. The question is how we can re-find our lost essence.The demonic qualities that obscure our collective consciousness have led us into an evolutionary cul-de-sac. We have fashioned societies that operate on the basis of our lowest level of functioning—structures based on greed, sexual aggression, and general power-madness. These systems of command and control, out of desperation to maintain control even though they have lost their claim to legitimacy, have shifted from primarily ideological and economic methods of maneuvering to the overwhelming application of intimidation and brute force.The system operates beyond the pale of reason. Empires act on the supervening mandate to increase profits, control all valuable resources, collect all possible information, eliminate all perceived enemies, and to function in secrecy with no moral limitations upon action. Humans have created monstrous mechanisms of power that are now bent on destroying their creators. And the need for the system to act in ways that no morally attuned consciousness could permit has led to the elimination of all but the most opportunist and amoral, not to say psychopathic and sociopathic, from most of the centers of power.We have used our vaunted intelligence to produce weapons with which we can destroy ourselves utterly and we have put them under the control of those least qualified by wisdom, compassion, and emotional maturity to wield such inconceivably lethal force. Moreover, out of the need to displace the collective anger from being aimed at the system of oppression, external enemies are routinely roused as objects of hatred, turning civilization into a permanent psychotic war dance. Our uncaring and foolish social policies have led to the karmic blowback of planetary overheating, toxic pollution of the water supply and the atmosphere, denaturing and contamination of food products, dangerous genetic modification of life forms, and impoverishment of the vast masses of the human population. All these and other foolish policies have put a stranglehold on our capacity to survive. In response to this human stupidity, the power of Gaia, our planet’s transpersonal organismic intelligence, is intervening by bringing about massive geological changes to remove what has become a cancer on the biosphere. We are that cancer. We either transform or we shall be eliminated. It is that simple.Here is where our latent theomorphic powers come in. Each of us has the capacity, through commitment to constant practice of Self-awareness, to transcend the egocentric mentality that has corrupted our character. We can quickly rebuild ourselves in the image of the Supreme I-consciousness. This means dedicated re-inculcation of the finest and most noble attributes that have always functioned as guiding human ideals. But because our will has become fragmented and dissipated, in the beginning our souls must take the support of others on the theomorphic path: a spiritual teacher; a community; the reading of inspired texts; a daily regimen of meditation, prayer, interpretation of one’s dreams, and other spiritual practices; a simple, clean, healthy, ethical lifestyle; and continuous focus on the goal of theomorphic transformation. This commitment in itself requires such humility and seriousness of purpose that few will be attracted to such a path. But the necessary numbers will be touched by divine inspiration to undertake the theomorphic project.Theomorphosis is not a human project, then but can only succeed when inspired and guided by the divine Intelligence, the Logos: otherwise known as the Holy Spirit. There are times in history—times of spiritual exhaustion and dire need of redemption after the human ego has lost touch with its supernal roots and the tree of life is withering—when the power of God mercifully returns from Its eclipse and seeds the Earth with the wisdom and light of love necessary for a new renaissance, a new order of the ages, one that is realigned with the might, the love, and truth of the Absolute.We are now passing through such a historic moment, when God is palpably with us in a way that is unique to such a momentous spiritual event. But only those who are attuned to the subtle reality of their subjective selfhood and who wholeheartedly seek union with the ultimate source of their being will become aware of this secret coming of the Supreme One. Now is the time to take advantage of this transcosmic event to overcome the downward pull of the egoic mind and attain liberation. In this great outflowing of divine power, whoever wishes may easily attain inner peace, bliss, healing, and even the fullness of psychospiritual perfection.We have the ability to make ourselves once more into beings of impeccable moral strength and courage; of cognitive clarity and creative intuitive profundity; of generosity and compassion; of serenity and universal love. Such a project of theosis will have profound impacts upon everyone in our circles of influence, as well as, more subtly, upon the natural environment. Once the collective energy field has increased its vibrational frequency to a certain unspecifiable critical threshold of global noetic resonance, a massive shift will occur at every level of psycho-ecological interaction. But to reach this level of Self-realization, we must approach our goal with fervor and unwavering dedication.The planetary conditions, meanwhile, are rapidly disintegrating, as everyone who is not in denial can plainly perceive. The crisis will continue to magnify exponentially until the final tipping point is reached. Then life on Earth will radically alter for everyone through a series of cataclysmic events that will bring the current age to an instant vanishing point. Through extraordinary tectonic processes, our contaminated continents will then sink into the depths and new virgin landmasses will rise from the ocean floor to become accessible for habitation by the surviving communities. Conditions will gradually become favorable for the inauguration of a new kind of divine culture. This kind of massive planetary transformation has occurred before, and is the subject of many of the world’s oldest myths and legends. Though modern science would find such a notion outrageous, there is more in heaven and earth, as Shakespeare said, than is dreamt of in our current philosophy.The present crisis is meant to awaken us from our egoic trance. We have forgotten what is Real, what is important, what we are, and how we might live together as a united human community, would we only choose the path of truth and nobility of spirit. The current decomposition of all social bonds is making us aware of our mistaken priorities, the lethal nature of our hubristic egocentricity, the utter contingency and unimportance of our continuing existence, should we choose to remain in our fallen state of arrogance and ignorance. Fortunately, we shall not all make such a choice.We have reached the moment of truth. In the coming collapse of our national and international systems of finance and trade, in the ongoing shattering of our families and social networks, in the rampant paranoia of burgeoning madness that is ripping apart the matrix of human existence, we have no choice but to realize that we have lost our way. We have lost the very ground of our Being. To recover our source and foundation, we must undertake an extreme inner makeover. To do that, we must surrender our total being—body, mind, heart, soul, and spirit—to the blessed omnipotence of the Supreme Self.The most important element of the theomorphic project is learning to silence the mind. Only when we have gained sovereignty over our mental agitations can we access and harness the most subtle and lifegiving energies of the Absolute’s Pure Presence. That is the point of Sat Yoga. It is the practice of constant union with the Absolute, known in Sanskrit terms as Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Awareness-Rapture). It is the practice of surrendering the ego mind and all its banal concerns to the ultimate Void that is the entrance to the mind of God.To achieve this sublime overarching goal, we must sacrifice our distractions and lesser intentions. We must give up our judgments and our opinions, our limited loyalties and attachments, our projections and externalizations. We must interiorize our awareness, renounce all egoistic self-images and representations, and retreat to our inmost essence. In the attainment of utter emptiness, we come upon the astonishing realization that what we had considered the external world is nothing but the manifestation of the Absolute. The dynamic impermanence of the world process is the eternal play of divine energies in the creative expression of infinite wisdom. Human history is but a cosmic cautionary tale of what happens when we forget who we are, and exists to provoke a permutation to ever-greater recognitions and introjections of the resources of our unlimited potentialities. Once we learn again to speak the language of God, life transcends the barrier of death and becomes one endless delight.One life ends, another begins. One age ends, another is born. The cycles of existence far surpass what can be understood by the egoic mind. But the message of Spirit is clear: Be not afraid. The environmental crisis is not an inconvenient truth, after all, but rather, the harbinger of the most wonderful advent possible. Such a wholistic paradigm of the cyclic nature of temporal reality was common currency in the ancient world. It became part of the patrimony of our cultural intelligence that we for centuries took for granted. It is as much a part of Greek and Roman understanding—read the writings of the Stoics, for example, or the dialogues of Plato, or the Enneads of Plotinus—as of the East. It is part of the perennial philosophy, embedded in the esoteric dimension of every world religion.What all the great religions prophesy—apocalypse, redemption, the return of the gods, the coming of the new kingdom of heaven on Earth, and so on—is now about to come to pass in the most unexpected way—a way that will befuddle the believers of those religions even as the prophecies are being fulfilled. This is because our religions have mistaken their textual signifiers for the signified, have misunderstood their own symbols, have taken metaphors too literally, have misinterpreted their founders’ teachings according to egoic wishes rather than transcendent wisdom. Yet the great sayings are true: The Saviour will come as a thief in the night. We need only prepare ourselves for the descent of grace, understanding, and liberation. God became man that man might become a god. The true Passover is yet to be observed. Build thee an ark, a merkabah, a lotus life, to float above the flood. Cleave to Allah. The hour of judgment is nigh. As Buddha says, work out your salvation with diligence. Become a theomorph.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nYoga	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:18:52	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.443202	2025-10-28 15:31:24.443202	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

That means it can’t win for losing. This biocomputer program with a built-in bug (or strange loop) is responsible for the feeling that spiritual liberation is impossible. The subliminal double-binding instruction for most people remains throughout life the governing agenda of the censoring agency that lies between the conscious identity and the repressed infantile self-system, manipulating the interpretation of reality and enforcing its agenda through the activation of a superego voice and the deployment of a barrage of sophisticated defense mechanisms that keep the consciousness split, confused, and working against its own interests.The double bind can be most easily understood in its original form as a way of coping with the impossible tension of separation versus symbiosis with the mother. The child loses no matter which alternative is chosen. If it fully separates from mother, the result is anxiety, the terror of facing a vast, alien world in a state of isolation and helplessness. If it chooses to cling to the mother, it loses its independence, it betrays its own desire for autonomy, its spirit is thereby broken, and it constantly fears complete loss of selfhood and freedom. Thus, the condition of self-hatred festers. Not being able to decide fully for either unbearable alternative, it remains caught in the double bind.There are as many variations of this bind structure as there are egos. Let us examine a few of the more common ones. We can classify them into withdrawal binds, aggression binds, superiority/inferiority binds, and authenticity/bullshit binds.Here is the history of a well-known aggression bind: A woman who, as a girl was angry at pathologically inept parents who did not listen to her. Either she had to throw tantrums to get attention, in which case she was punished, or she became passive and fell into despair. Years later, she romantically connects only with men who cannot be there for her, and she is constantly faced with the choice of either being enraged or throwing in the towel and feeling abused. Love is defined as giving up one’s autonomy and one’s hope, and her only connection with her partner is with his traumatized and furious ‘inner child’, with whom she colludes in a mutual re-traumatization ritual. Her relationships are doomed to be the serial futile pairings of hungry ghosts on a rampage—unless she finds a way to escape the double bind.Then there is the man who as a child found he got better care when he acted helpless and withdrawn. So now, whenever he takes the initiative and acts powerfully in the world he feels abandonment anxiety. If he withdraws, he feels protected, though he is actually undermining his position in the world. If he comes out strong, he soon collapses in anxiety, and finds a way to justify giving up and going back into his cave. His withdrawal double bind keeps him from confidently building a life.Then there are the many varieties of sexual aggression binds. In the most common, a woman does everything possible to be found irresistible by a man, but then hates him for treating her as an object. The man usually reciprocates by losing interest in her the minute he defines her as having been conquered. In these cases, others who are potential sexual partners have value only to the extent they have not been captured—or to the extent they can be used as part of the larger game of social climbing. Often, the partner is desired precisely for what makes him undesirable—to ensure that one remains in control and unafraid of rejection, and to have a scapegoat on whom to project one’s own shadow. Being caught in such a relationship bind can use up all one’s mental energies, so that one never has to face the deeper issue of being clueless regarding one’s real Self. One’s thoughts are a whirlwind circling around a false self-representation.The double bind structure precipitates the creation of a superego—an internal judge of the self-representation that has been captured in the bind. Once that is in place, the superego voice then becomes the instrument of a second layer of psychic binds. The voice makes the demand to ‘be good’. The self-representation either rebels against this demand and is stung by guilt, or gives in and once more feels enslaved and weak. It becomes filled with the affect of self-loathing. To counter the power of the superego voice with its impossible hyper-ethical demands, the subliminal censor creates yet another voice, a demonic voice that demands that the self-representation violate the ethical laws of internal and social obligation (‘don’t call your mother,’ ‘have another drink,’ ‘tell the boss to stuff it’). The ego then enjoys the delicious feeling of power that comes with sticking it to the superego.But the price is bad karma and fear of losing the support of the superego and collapsing. So some sort of punishment is induced. It can be interpersonal isolation, self-sabotage, or psychosomatic pain. Migraines are a common example. With this maneuver, the double bind is changed into a double enjoyment. The physical symptom justifies the antisocial behavior, like missing work or some other (perhaps sexual) obligation. So the demonic voice scores a point. The hyper-ethical superego also scores, as it enjoys punishing the poor self-representation by inflicting pain upon it, while the demonic superego rescues it with medicines that make it high, drugs that otherwise would be illicit and would not be allowed by the ethical superego—thus the self-representation finally also scores a point. In other words, everyone wins—but only because all sides lose. This is the wheel of karma on which the ego is bound.Probably the saddest case is the double bind of the idealistic person. A person whose self-image is that of someone who is very spiritual and loving has a problem: To protect that image she cannot afford to do real inner work, since the work would uncover unbearable feelings of lack and negativity that would demolish the false image of the ‘beautiful soul’—and reveal the deeper abject self images against which she is defending. Such people want only a diluted, airbrushed, pop version of the spiritual quest, not the anxiety-provoking blood-and-guts-dark-night-of-the-soul version that is required for authentic liberation.On the other hand, there are people who manipulatively adopt the spiritual journey as a way to evade responsibility for important life tasks. They avoid work and family obligations by claiming their time must go to the higher task of meditation. Yet they avoid real commitment to the spiritual path by claiming they have to take care of a partner or ailing mother or hold an exhausting job. And all the time, they are really attending properly neither to their horizontal dharma of work and family, nor to their vertical dharma of spiritual liberation. Instead, they usually spend their free time sleeping, daydreaming, watching movies, eating, or indulging the ego in other ways. They believe they can fool others, including their spiritual guide, with such games, but they are caught in a bind in which they are the only ones being fooled.The jackpot question, of course, is how to escape the double bind. This has been the core focus of the research into transformational psychotechnology that yogic scientists have been pursuing for centuries. Buddha was such a researcher, as were Patanjali, Shankara, Hillel, Jesus, Pythagoras, Plotinus, Hermes Trismegisthus, Bodhidharma, and Lao Tze, to name some of the more famous sages in the ancient world. Some of their research has by necessity remained secret (because it cannot be put into ordinary language, but must be transmitted directly, energetically, by teacher to disciple).But most of it is an open secret. It can be said simply, but the words cannot be understood, at least not by one whose internal censor is still operating. Some techniques are obvious. For example, the main approach to undoing a double bind is to create a countervailing double bind. One can see this at work in Zen in the use of a koan, such as: “What is the essence of zen? If you speak, you’ll be hit thirty times. If you stay silent, you will be hit thirty times!”In many schools of psychotherapy, the intention is likewise to create a therapeutic double bind. For example, having accepted a therapist as an expert in achieving transformation, one’s resistance to insight and growth becomes clear even to oneself as being pathological and unsupportable. So if one accepts the therapist, one will inevitably open one’s heart and mind to one’s real being; if one resists the therapist, one is implicitly admitting the need for more therapy. Therefore, the only effective strategy to avoid self-transformation is to de-legitimize the therapist in one’s mind. Often it only takes a little distortion by projection, a little provocation, and a little collusion with friends or family to accomplish that maneuver, and voila, one’s ego is liberated from the bind of therapy.Religious double binds are more sturdy than therapeutic ones, but less, well, therapeutic. In other words, if you accept x religion, it means you accept that you are both one of the chosen and a sinner. One side of the bind thus gets clamped on. Now, as a sinner, you long for redemption, for mystic union with God. Here comes the other side of the bind: if you claim to have achieved such union, you are a heretic, and therefore a worse sinner. Thus, you must continue to long for the supreme union, but you must never achieve it.A more fundamental double bind is inherent to the spiritual quest. The ego-mind longs for liberation from its sense of lack, but it is weighed down by the fear of an inauthentic ‘Self-realization’, in which one fools oneself into believing that one has attained God-consciousness when it has only been a grand illusion. This is a profound question, because we all know of exactly such cases of gurus who thought they were a lot further along than they really were. And indeed it is true that any appropriation by the ego of a sense of enlightenment is false and misleading. However, it is also true that that ‘I is not the ego’. Any use of language that proclaims ‘I am the Light’ will automatically be perceived by others to be a claim that the ego is declaring itself divine. But we must not throw out the baby (God) with the dirty bathwater of egoic inflation. It is a valid inner realization that ‘I the Light (or the Void or the Self) am not the ego’. In that realization, there are no longer two entities, on the one side Light/God/Self/Void (take your pick) and on the other, mind/ego/body. Rather, the latter dissolves into the former. When transactions resume in the world of apparent duality, the ego is allowed to humbly take up its duties again, but decathected of libidinal energy, to use Freudian terms, while the luminous Self/Void remains as silent laughing loving presence.This is the key to escaping the double bind: Eliminate egoic identification, and there is nothing that can be bound. Consciousness can begin by realizing its nature is simply difference from its contents. No matter what consciousness is aware of—a face in the mirror, words in the mind, memories, fantasies, bodily activities, affects—consciousness remains beyond any of its contents. Consciousness is nothing in itself, absolutely nothing, only pure awareness. And the primary content of consciousness is a sequence of ego-identifications that flow within the awareness as exemplars of a limitless range of potentialities rather than constituting an entity of some kind.There is no entity called I, only a variety of partial self-representations and affects that appear and disappear on a spectrum from the darkest and most negative to the most rapturous, luminous, and boundless. Once both ‘the self’ and ‘the other’ have been liberated from objectification, negative emotions based on either a power struggle, a rejection scenario, or an envy relation all dissolve, and in the ensuing flow of love and care our creative intelligence will spontaneously surge in a transformational stream of pure consciousness. In that mode, all problems can be easily solved. Once the vital energy of Life, known in the West as Eros and in India as Kundalini, is freed from egoic desire—from the short-circuit caused by the inherent double bind that is egoic identification—consciousness regains its natural bioluminosity. We get our halo back.Once the blocks and binds have been removed, consciousness returns to its eternal source. Consciousness is emptiness, the emptiness that reveals itself as luminous form. The entire universe is the divine hide-and-seek game of Self-concealment and Self-revelation. No separate egos ever existed. So that is how to get out of a double bind: there was never anyone to get caught in the first place, and therefore no one needs to be liberated. (If ‘you’ don’t yet realize this, have no fear. At some moment, the Nothing will come, like a thief in the night: Emptiness will dissolve the illusion of your separate existence. ‘Your’ destiny is Rapture.)Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming Obstacles	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:17:14	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.446664	2025-10-28 15:31:24.446664	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

This has been the deepest yearning of humanity since the dawn of recorded time, the raison d’etre of every religion, the message of every great prophet and sage in history. But now our time has run out. We cannot wait for some messiah or avatar or revolutionary movement or benign extraterrestrials or any other form of utopian Other to accomplish the redemption for us. We must do the work of inner transformation ourselves—and do it immediately.The transformation of consciousness has become THE existential imperative. We either transform now or succumb to extinction. Whether we succeed or fail as an evolutionary experiment will be determined by us, the set of presently existing human beings. And the transformation required can only be achieved one human being at a time. It cannot be mass-produced, although we can accelerate the process by creating a planetary culture that supports this achievement. But someone must go first. We ourselves, each of us who become aware of the imperative, must become role models of the attainment of that supreme ideal.Each of us must take responsibility for our own inner development—for achieving ego death, followed by sacred rebirth as manifestations of the one Cosmic Self. Out of the illusion that we are many, we must realize we are one—this is the real meaning of the credo on the U.S. dollar bill: E Pluribus Unum. What is necessary is not an egoic parody of unity, in the form of submission to empire, or empty new-age nostrums that mask the persistence of infantile ego-systems, but the authentic oneness of the Divine Presence, made possible through rigorous disciplines of self-transformation, meditation, and radical paradigm shift.It is an ethical imperative that we make the project of self-transformation the top item on our life’s agenda. Without the attainment of sacred rebirth into our highest and most genuine potential Selfhood, all else is in vain. We owe such a metamorphosis to our loved ones, to our ancestors and our descendants—but most of all, we owe it to our Self, to the Source of our existence, to the supreme power and intelligence that has created us all.It is not only a moral but a psychological imperative that we transform now. Unless we do, the dark shadow forces in our psyche will wreak havoc with our emotional stability, if they are not doing so already. As the collective psychic energies on the planet become more chaotic and pathological, the waves of anxiety, paranoia, and despair threaten to overwhelm us. The unshakeable peace and serenity of our inmost Being is our only refuge in such a time. To reach the sheltering energies of the One—our immanent/transcendent God-Self—the ego must first be transfigured, made transparent to the supernal Light that shines from our inner depths.It can even be said that transformation is a political imperative. Both left and right wing movements have in the past century brought about horrors of mass murder and enslavement. Without a transformation of consciousness, there is no way to overcome systemic corruption, scapegoating, and power-madness. Unfortunately, the left has jumped to the wrong conclusions from Marxist and postmodern insights into the class, gender, race, and other identity conflicts that lie behind the fraying façade of unity characterizing contemporary societies. But political revolution, even were it possible, would not lead to a transformation of consciousness. The same egoic forces win every political battle. The ego itself must be conquered—no other sort of revolution will suffice.The egoic multitudes that populate today’s empires can never attain unity or harmony so long as they remain in the trance of false consciousness. Aggression, deceit, and projection are inherent to the ego. As frustration increases, the paranoid collective ego is prone to psychotic lashing-out as well as suicidal collapse. This is why ever more authoritarian regimes are being imposed, and human rights gradually eliminated. No empire can maintain hegemony for long over the sectarian hordes that are overrunning one failed state after another.But it should not be overlooked that the ego is inherently schismogenetic. Schisms will eventually break apart every movement, every group, and every governing coalition. Not even spiritual groups are immune to this tendency of egocentric behavior. Only transcendence of the ego can make durable unity possible. There can be no long-term cohesion even within the most rigid sects unless such a revolutionary psycho-spiritual development takes place. Eventually, as Hobbes predicted, egos will be in a state of total war of all against all. Spiritual transformation is imperative because it alone can create a new political event horizon. It alone has the power to potentiate the creative energies that can stimulate a global cultural renaissance.The current perilous biopolitical situation of human beings is a blessing in disguise. It forces us to do what we would otherwise leave to future generations. But there will be no future human lifetimes on this planet if we do not act now to change the course of our destiny from our present suicidal trajectory toward one that is realigned with the power of love and truth. The current situation also makes clear that real power is not in the hands of the political elites any longer. As the world’s political systems devolve, their breakdown is leaving a vacuum. The legitimacy of the old order, the established identificatory alignments, including extended families and religious organizations, is dissolving in dysfunction, in scandal and hypocrisy, in empty ritual and irrelevance.Many people, unable to contemplate the dizzying possibilities of this period of kaleidoscopic change, remain stunted and stifled in their futile enmeshments with obsolete signifiers of identity and status. The majority has chosen denial as a way of avoiding the anxiety of radical uncertainty. Others have entered a period of spiritual nomadism. They are wandering through a desert of meaningless social activity, or else have embarked upon a determined search for higher understanding, seeking a Star to lead them to a new Bethlehem—some to a manger where they themselves can be reborn as avatars. Some seek new fountains of truth and genuine love. They seek to align themselves with those who display the signs of true worthiness: egoless wisdom, incorruptibility, dispassion, universal love, purity of mind and life, unshakeable inner peace and serenity.The problem is: life has a long learning curve. Everyone on a spiritual path is growing, aspiring toward the absolute of human perfection, but few have reached it. We stumble on the way, and sometimes we fall. And those we look up to will also fall, from time to time. This recognition of frailty in ourselves and even in our teachers and guides must always keep us humble in our attitude toward others, not judgmental or vengeful, but always forgiving.Our loyalty to God grows as we learn, and gradually we renounce our temptations as we find the balm of acceptance and healing in God’s grace. Because we cannot wait for perfect individuals to appear, we must take the risk to sculpt our own perfection, and to go as far as possible using conscience as our compass, serenity as our barometer, and the wisdom of great sages as our inspiration.When we meet someone who can take us further on our journey, who can open our eyes to deeper truths and more universal love, we ought not refuse the opportunity to grow. We must gain genuine autonomy, discernment, and inner union with the One Light.Working through the egoic distortions of our thought processes, fomented by unconscious anxieties, is an extremely difficult undertaking. It is the Great Work, as the alchemists have said, but it must be approached with reverence and trepidation. It is like walking a razor’s edge. To have any chance of succeeding, we must learn the art of meekness, yet boldly wield the dagger of Truth.As Christ has taught us, the meek shall inherit the earth. Communities of those dedicated to the ideal of meekness (a word that derives from Sanskrit via Latin, mansuetudo, meaning one whose true Self, swa, has conquered his egoic mind, manas) are now forming, guided by those with sufficient integrity and equanimity to have transcended at least most of the lower egoic identifications, and who support one another in achieving ever higher development of goodness and spiritual power. They are learning to work together to overcome psychic barriers to developing fearless, truth-seeking, compassionate, holocentric, narcissism-free relationships. Such communities, learning to live in harmony once again with Nature, developing sustainable ecological modes of production and consumption—if they can also maintain ethical and ego-transcendent modes of conscious interbeing—are destined to prosper and provide models for the next age of humanity.It is imperative that we ourselves become such beings of simplicity and wise living, of pure faith and divine power, not simply worshippers of one or another being who achieved that goal in the past. It is the only way to survive and benefit from this time of troubles, and to be a blessing to others.We must become Buddhas, not merely Buddhists. We must be avatars of Vishnu and Shiva, not merely Hindus who worship them. We must be Christed, not be content with remaining mere believing Christians. We must become prophets of Allah, not mere proselytizers. We must alchemically transform, not just be scholars of alchemy.We must metabolize the highest human psycho-spiritual potentials that lie dormant within us, not simply preach or philosophize about that possibility. Our surrender to God must be complete, not mere lip service. Let us use all the tools and insights of every religion, every philosophy, every science, every school of psychoanalysis and therapy to attain this goal. It is necessary to overcome our limited identification with any single religion or ideology and open to receive the wisdom of our entire human heritage of intellectual and spiritual development. We need all the help we can get.Today, as never before, the physical sciences also converge on the emergent unifying spiritual paradigm to offer support and crucial insights into the processes of transformation and transcendence. Science in past centuries led human consciousness away from the chains of religion. But that was religion that had fallen into degraded and dogmatic misunderstanding of its own mythologically-coded information streams.Today, every field of science has been revolutionized by the recognition of the necessity to factor in the reality of consciousness. In physics, the most recent mindbending theoretical breakthroughs—mindbending from the Newtonian perspective, but commonplace to realized yogis—in quantum physics and cosmology, yielding such concepts as higher dimensions and parallel universes, relativity, wormholes and time travel, and most importantly, of the fundamental place of consciousness in the constitution of reality—have served to re-legitimize the metaphysics of the Yogis of ancient India.The same metaphysical insights are at the core of every esoteric tradition, continually reaffirmed by prophets, mystics, and sages of all religions. New understandings in evolutionary biology supporting the concept of intelligent design have even destabilized the neo-darwinian dogma that has limited the scientific imagination to a flattened reductionistic account of reality. The dead-end of materialism is being overcome in minds that had been ideologically hammered into submission for centuries. A renaissance of scientific spirituality is taking place, one that no longer needs to hide in the corners or apologize for its failure to accept the death of God.Science is re-energizing the spiritual quest. Psychology is helping even more. The overthrow of the old behavioral paradigm that denied the existence or relevance of consciousness has brought the vastness of the unconscious and superconscious realms back into theoretical play in the therapeutic culture wars.Great efforts are underway to integrate psychoanalysis with the insights of Buddhism and Advaita. Jungian analysis, archetypal and transpersonal psychology movements are all advancing, capturing the hungry imagination of new graduates in the field. Lacanian analysis has triumphed in many of the world’s psychoanalytic communities, an approach that unmasks the illusory nature of the ego, and leads to “benign depersonalization,” a concept compatible with the nondualist teachings of Eastern spiritual paths. Sullivanian analysis and post-Kohutian approaches are coming to similar understandings.European poststructural philosophy, extending the work of such thinkers as Husserl, Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze has also taken a spiritual turn, recharging the field of non-dualist theology. Dazzling thinkers such as Kitaro Nishida, Shinichi Hisamatsu, Keiji Nishitani, and Masao Abe, of the Kyoto School of Zen philosophy, have forged an elegant rapprochement between Buddhism and Western theology and philosophy. God, no longer reduced to an anthropomorphic Other, but now in the formless form of Absolute Nothingness, the unknowable yet immediately present truth of our intelligent self-aware universe, is making a comeback.We must, of course, ensure that the transformational urge does not become re-appropriated by egoic religion. Sat Yoga is not a religion but a secular set of experimental psycho-spiritual practices. These are protected by ethical parameters that ensure that the results do not become contaminated or misused by the ego. The secular nature of Yoga has led to its adoption as a psycho-technology by all the religions of the East. Meditative practice transcends all possible discursive paradigms. Thus, there are literatures of Shaivite yoga, Vaishnavite yoga, Advaita yoga, Buddhist yoga, and Taoist yoga, to name but a few.Unfortunately, in the West, the signifier “yoga” has in recent years come popularly to refer to a recent elaboration of one of its preliminary practices, that of asanas, the well-known physical stretching and balancing postures, rather than the true aim of yoga, the achievement of samadhi—which is the state of pure awareness in which all thought-constructs and other mental noise have been eliminated.The physical practice of asanas played only a small role in the preparatory transformational activities of the original Yogis. Read even a late text like the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and you will find little reference to asanas. The point of asana practice was simply to learn to sit comfortably in order to be able to meditate for long periods without moving. The Yoga Sutras are dedicated to the attainment of samadhi and the attendant siddhis, the psycho-spiritual powers that come along with advanced mental development.Today’s stunted understanding of Yoga as a form of physical exercise is a symptom of the narcissistic degradation and materialism that have contaminated even the most profound spiritual traditions. The emphasis on physical prowess has led to the unfortunate spectacle of exhibitionistic hatha yogis more proud of their ability to stand on their head than to overturn their ego.The goal of Sat Yoga is nothing less than the transformation and transcendence of ego-consciousness. Through its practices, we can learn to live in the supramental levels of our Being. Sat Yoga carries forward the work of many modern sages, including Sri Aurobindo, whose integral yoga aims at the downloading of the Supermind into our individual consciousness. The main difference between Sri Aurobindo’s effort and our own is that Sat Yoga imports the clinical wisdom gained in the West through a century of psychoanalytic exploration into the praxis of transformation. By applying such skills as symptom and dream analysis in one-to-one atmanology sessions of free associative self-inquiry, while being held in the safety of a positive pranic energy field, yielding the gradual understanding of drives based on subconscious phantasy structures, and promoting a revitalization of cellular energies, the process of transformation is greatly accelerated.The term Sat Yoga means union with our essential noumenal Being. This use of the term Being refers to what is more appropriately called the Ground of Being. It is the fundament of Being that is beyond the dualities of being and non-being, the ultimate Real that no words can adequately explain or describe. Therefore, we sometimes also refer to It as our Supreme Being.In other words, Sat Yoga is the disciplined practice of living egolessly.Meditation is the core activity of Sat Yoga. Serious practitioners make the time to sit regularly for about an hour at a time twice a day, in addition to occasional retreats in which we sit for eight or ten hours daily, in a state of mental silence, with our whole attention centered on the Self within. Eventually, the tendency to produce egoic thought constructs subsides and the Self emerges in fullness. Our transpersonal identity reveals itself as timeless presence, serenity, love, clarity, wisdom, luminosity, and all-embracing emptiness.To achieve the ultimate transfiguration, the ego must first be purified. Three overarching vows prove useful: commitment to a simple lifestyle that supports transformation; continual analysis of one’s ego dynamics; and daily engagement in benevolent actions that inspire others to bring out the best that is in them. Transubstantiating the ego is the best gift we can offer to humanity.Human psychological transformation is imperative. Let us quickly do our own inner work and then help as many others as possible. Self-realization is not a luxury for the upper classes. It is the only means of liberation for all beings everywhere. It is also the ultimate adventure. Here is a cause that can be the vehicle of endless creativity, insight, and delight.To open the heart to the awesome energies of divine love is the sweetest bliss. To live in virtue and nobility of spirit is the most profound satisfaction. To dwell in ceaseless mindful union with the Absolute is an incomparable rapture. Transformation is imperative. It is also our destiny, our timeless telos in this cosmic play that is the sport of the Supreme Intelligence. There is a profound urge within us all to realize our oneness with the Creator, the Dreamer of this strange and wondrous dream that is the universe. This urge will manifest spontaneously at some moment. But we can accelerate that occurrence by our efforts to achieve Self-realization. Let us, therefore, enter courageously into the unknown Presence that is the Self, assent to the ascent, the advent of the great adventure: our conscious transformation into the full manifestation of who and what we already are eternally—we have nothing to lose but our suffering.\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nOvercoming ObstaclesState of the World	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:13:09	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.449516	2025-10-28 15:31:24.449516	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

That is not an easy question to answer. Because one could say yes, and be correct. And one could say no, and also be correct.Let us say that we are teaching a unique, multimodal approach to the living realization of the nondual nature of our true Reality. Our approach values the struggles and victories (and the apparent losses as well) that make up the path toward the ultimate realization as well as the goal, the unitive realization itself. Perhaps the best description of the Sat Yoga Approach is to call it Advaita+ (Advaita plus a map of the levels of consciousness leading from the conflictual multiplicity of ego-consciousness to the realization of the Supreme Reality plus a variety of processes designed to bring about such transformation).Perhaps the major drawback of ordinary Advaita is the underestimation of the power of the ego to appropriate the discourse of nonduality for its own covert narcissistic agenda, and the lack of sufficiently powerful means to depotentiate the ego and release its hold upon consciousness. Sat Yoga offers a methodology to ensure that the ego cannot continue its parasitic possession of our being. To realize the truth that underlies its verbal representation in Advaita discourse, we require a methodology that ensures that our spiritual guides actually walk the walk, not simply talk the talk.Moreover, in order to break through the bedrock of the ego’s narrative construction, we must develop the skills of deep listening, of listening with the third ear, as the psychoanalyst Theodor Reik felicitously phrased it. This practice enables us to overcome the blind spots in our conscious awareness, and to help others go beyond theirs. In the practice of meditation, along the way toward achieving sahaja samadhi, or nisarga samadhi, as we term it—the natural state of nondual awareness, of inner silence and presence that remains constant throughout the day and night, throughout the states of waking, dream, and deep sleep—many phenomena of imperience (as opposed to experience) may arise. The adept spiritual guide ought to be able to help an aspirant overcome such demons of the deep unconscious—ranging from moments of agony or anxiety to paranormal phenomena to psychotic fragmentation to chronic distress, depression, fatigue, somatic conversion pain, or other psychospiritual symptoms. Neither ordinary Advaita nor ordinary psychotherapy offers a sufficient solution to such problems.Some approaches to Advaita simply dismiss as illusion the levels of consciousness in which identification with some entity or archetype less encompassing than Parabrahman remains. Our approach does not dismiss those levels—and the insights and passions they ignite—as worthless. On the contrary, though they are certainly of only limited validity and value, in comparison to the realization of ultimate Reality, for the consciousness that is working its way toward the more sublime astonishment of nondual apperception, the melange of forces and tragicomic conundrums created in and by the maelstrom of Maya, are of extraordinary relevance. This is true of the ego’s understanding of its own unconscious puppeteer, and it is true of the higher levels of development that bring experiences of God or other visionary mystical states. None of these are ultimate, but their study can yield enormous transformational unfoldment. This is where the philosophy of Sat Yoga and mainstream Advaita differ—in emphasis more than in ultimate substance. But because our path includes a one-to-one relationship of guide and student in which empathic attunement is essential, the gradual (or sometimes sudden) reconceptualization of one’s existence leads to an accumulation of inner richness—in the form of greater capacity to love, to play, to think, to act decisively, to relate to others in a healthy, spontaneous, virtuous, mutually empowering way, among other benefits. This recuperation of joy and wisdom does not always occur in the classical Advaita path, which can be austere, repetitive, and even autistic in its emphasis on self-inquiry, and the absence of a relational component. This can result in an impoverished life, rather than an enriched one.In fact, the fruits of inner transformation through relational paradigm-shifting comprise much of the substantial content of the spiritual journey, and it is the truthful confrontation of the projective illusions of ego versus other (I emphasize the word truthful) that produces the divine nectar of compassion, detachment, and acceptance that in turn intoxicates consciousness with the higher bliss of ego dissolution and the uncanny laughter that comes with the direct awareness of what is really going on here.It is the patient inner work of peeling away the layers of illusion, the false axioms and paradigms that subtend the ego complex, depotentiating the irrational behavior, the paralyzing repressed conflicts, loosening the tightly wound springs of the egoic affects, that makes up much of the daily process of the spiritual warrior, leading to the ultimate unwinding of the egoic illusion as a whole. But this inner work of deconstruction is what requires the real courage and perseverance—and yields the real fruits of wisdom—that enable one to gain the necessary compassion and understanding to guide others on the path to Jivan Mukti, or Liberation, as well.Beyond that, this work of gaining insight into human nature gives greater depth and richness of understanding of what may aptly be called divine nature. To understand from the highest Advaitic perspective the planetary/historic process of which we are a part, the spiraling intensities of cyclic time, in which the oscillation of our manifestation mutates from divine to demonic and back again, enables us to ride the crest of the transformational wave to its collapse and quantum reconfiguration. In the same way that reading Shakespeare or Rumi or William Blake or Marcel Proust can transmit a kind of understanding that one does not get from reading Kant or Hegel or Einstein (not to mention Shankara or Ramana), one’s approach to spiritual development can be either narrow-gauged or broad-gauged. The poetics of enlightenment ought not be limited to the simple truth that the ego is an illusion, and let’s be done with it. The divine play, the cosmic Leela, is far too beautiful, with an aesthetic complexity and taste far beyond that of the finest wine or the most creative literature, and all that beauty and intelligence ought not be wasted. That too is finally the work of Brahman, or Shiva, or Purusha, or Buddha-nature, or whatever name one chooses to bestow upon the Absolute. Advaita need not be a one-note melody.In other words, our approach perceives a more fertile Advaita, a more flowering, empowering, overflowing fullness that unfolds along the path to our ultimate Oneness.In the same way that meditation practice is not boring to those who know the bliss of nonduality, but to those whose consciousness remains mired in the ego-construct made of words and imaginary melodramas, it is a boring waste of time, or an irresistible opportunity to fall asleep—in the same way, Advaita can seem a boring negation of the logic of egoic drives or it can be apperceived as the dance of the devas to the angelic/symphonic music of the transcosmic spheres.The path of Sat Yoga recognizes and encourages students and seekers on the spiritual path to annul immediately the pathological aspects of identification—but to do so not as an act of renunciation, but of poetic justice. To start on the path from where we really are, not from where we wish to be or pretend to be, is essential for ultimate success. To achieve most rapidly that success, called Liberation or Enlightenment or Self-Realization, we can use more tools than simply the cognitive recognition of the non-reality of the egoic pseudo-entity. We can take advantage, for instance, of the insights of contemporary psychoanalysis (but in the form of a far more encompassing Advaitic/Yogic paradigm, which we are calling clinical atmanology)—including the fact that much of our mental activity takes place beyond the ken of our waking consciousness, beyond the control of our waking mind, and sequestered from our reach by intricate defense mechanisms. Therefore, to win the battle against the diabolic intelligence of the Shadow (to use a Jungian term—referring to the part of the ego that lies beneath “normal” consciousness and which has power to control the flow of information that actually reaches our waking ego-consciousness), it pays to understand the dynamics of its operation. We can also benefit from being able to decode messages that come from an even deeper level, sometimes from what Jung called the archetypal level, sometimes from beyond that level, from the luminous intelligence of Atman itself, through our nightly dreams and our psychophysical symptoms, as well as our karmic entanglements—if we have the power to correctly interpret them. Gaining these skills is a legitimate—in fact, I would even say essential—part of the spiritual journey for many individuals. It is the full understanding of the egoic game that brings vairagya, or dispassion, that finally becomes the realization that we are not separate individuals at all, nor ever were.In the same way, the Yogic map of psychic energy vortexes and assemblage points that is the underpinning of spiritual paths that have flourished all over the world throughout history—from Hinduism and Buddhism to alchemy, Hermeticism, and esoteric Judaeo-Christian-Islamic mystical traditions—still has tremendous value in realigning our intellectual paradigm with that of contemporary science as well as the phenomenology of our own transformational process. And of course there is no single practice that is of more value than that of meditation itself—meditation in the sense that Ramana and Nisargadatta and Shankara would approve—inquiry into the greatest mystery of all: Who am I? But even in the case of meditation practice, there is value in offering to students who need it more elementary and preparatory exercises. These may include asanas and pranayamas, or guided visualizations, or breath-counting techniques, or the more elaborate techniques of analytic meditation. Without losing sight of the goal, one can help people whose anxiety levels would otherwise not permit them to meditate, to reach such calmness and serenity that they are ready to face the far more profound question of ultimate identity. Beyond that, a framework of ethical and psycho-hygienic observances and self-restraints, referred to in Yoga as the Yamas and Niyamas, remain an important safety device for those who enter into the deep waters of supramental exploration.So this is our path of Sat Yoga. Is it a form of Advaita? Only a very threatened or narrow mind would deny it. Does it encompass within itself elements that are not normally found in traditional Advaita? Of course. But if one is truly a nondualist, one recognizes the integral oneness of that which those who remain in illusion cannot see as connected and pertinent. We accept a constantly evolving Advaita, a path that makes use of the wisdom of all traditions, clinical observations, and philosophic insights that help in the achievement of the sweet perfection of our natural state. The natural samadhi that is our spiritual birthright is one of rest and peace, of love and acceptance, honoring all the apparent diversity that displays the transfinite creativity of the One Supreme Self. We have nothing to prove or preach. If you need the brand name “Advaita” and the guarantees of some celebrity gurus before you are willing to try it, then you are not ready for this more subtle sort of path. On the other hand, if this path seems of value to you, take from it what it offers that is of benefit, and leave the rest. If it seems utterly foreign, move on until you find what you are looking for. But if you have spent time with traditional Advaita, and you have the sense that its message is true, but it leaves you nonetheless with an illusory ego that you cannot shake off, despite your lack of belief in it, then you may be interested in another approach—one that will actually enable you to arrive at where you truly already are. Sat Yoga can bring you here.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nNonduality	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-06-30 19:11:05	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.454262	2025-10-28 15:31:24.454262	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The more of the lower force that is surrendered, the more higher power is attained and harnessed, channeled into the world to multiply itself, to strengthen its self-emanating field of morphic resonance, and to transform the chaos of phenomenal flux that is breaking apart and disintegrating, into a fluidly self-reorganizing massive conscious singularity, a transcendental object in the Mind of God.Despite the distortions and dumbed-down presentation, despite the grating dialogue and acting and casting necessitated by the marketing of the myth to immature minds as this version of The Chronicles of Narnia must be to appear at the end of kali yuga, nonetheless the information is still there, if one knows how to apply it to one’s imperiential existence and recognize the true nature of the battle that must be won. If we are too pseudo-sophisticated to have time for fairy tales, we may miss the thread that leads to liberation.This personal mythology of C.S. Lewis lies between the more simplistic Wizard of Oz approach and the far more elaborate and otherworldly Tolkien tales. It is a close cousin to Alice in Wonderland. Its distinction is the more clear and open expression of the Christ archetype versus the shamanic metaphor that yields more information regarding siddhi acquisition. But a version could easily be imagined in which the Lion King Aslan is more like a Buddha, or a Krishna, or Moses. The Real Being can be described according any of the Crazy Diamond’s infinite facets. The failing of this version, which it shares with nearly all corrupted mythology, but which makes it the more cinematic, is the translation of transformation into war. This is the main cause of the appearance of war in the world, justified by the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Torah, the Koran, and all the other versions. Only Buddhism managed to portray an entirely internal jihad against the cause of suffering, named therein as craving. And outer war does in fact become a necessary force to awaken the powers that alone can win the inner war that reunites inner and outer under the sovereignty of the Supreme Power that rules on Earth as It does in Heaven.Make note of all the symbols in this film: they are also archetypes that we must earn, receive, and learn to use. The sword, the horn, the healing tincture, the bow and arrow, the various powers, processes, and persecutions implicit in the unfoldment of the eternal Great Event that now has become our highest priority to prepare for—and perhaps most of all the lesson of how to deal with betrayal—make the film a worthy study text for avataric heroes in the making. Notice too the little nuances like the crowns, two of gold for the elder brother and sister, two of silver for the younger duo, representing two dynasties, the sat yuga and the treta yuga lineages. They are brother-sister rulers, or in other words, Brahmacharis.And of course the metaphor of the wardrobe as the portal: behind all the clothes, the personae and their sub-personalities, the dissociated fragments of superficial consciousness, lies another world within, deeper than thought, language or context.But beware of backing into the bardo and running into the wrong kind of witch, one who runs with the wolves of the death drive.In the end it is just another map of the territory known as You or I.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/11.png	\N	2019-06-30 17:30:08	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.456746	2025-10-28 15:31:24.456746	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It was released in 1941, just as the Second World War is becoming all too serious. This comedy was a flop at the box office and has nearly been forgotten, dropped down the cinematic memory hole. But it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, a renowned auteur of classic films. Why did this film of his fail to find an audience? The reviews tend to say that the film was too insubstantial. It was called “mere candy” by the New York Times. But is the problem that the film is too sweet—or that it was, and perhaps still is, too bitter for an audience in ego consciousness to be able to swallow? And is it possible that the real tragicomedy of this film was never appreciated? It is a comedy that laughs at who we are when we are at our best, not just at our worst.The film offers a multi-level set of dialogues: a woman with her hiccups; a woman with her female friends and their influence as part of a social system; a woman with her fantasies and her drives; and a woman dissatisfied with her husband trying first to defeat him, and then, after realizing his strength, trying (and fearing) to be a real person, even perhaps a soul, with her counter-gambiting husband.It is also a film about the husband and his relationship with his business persona; with his male friends and colleagues for whom he must remain in the power position of the alpha male; with his ostensible enemy, who has seemingly stolen his wife’s affection, but who deserves at one level only pity, though at another he deserves awe; with the husband’s own soul and that of his wife, and even with that of his whole social world; and the effort of both husband and wife to rise to the occasion of the most profound challenge to their relationship that they have yet faced.The film reveals a great deal of profound information regarding the relationship of the human being to love. There is on display the impersonal force of the drives; the personal game playing, lies, and manipulation of the ego; and yet also something more, a deeper more authentic love that keeps anyone in the film from harming anyone else, even when there is punching and slapping. The film reminds us it is a cartoon, a comedy, a vehicle for the redemption of the human soul trapped in its identification with its ego. And it loves even the ego with a generosity and compassion of a Bodhisattvic intelligence.The film makes fun of psychoanalysis as well. The therapeutic act is portrayed as a combination of coercive honesty, seductive dishonesty, manipulative matchmaking, and reductive meaning-making. The drive tension manifested by the patient as a hiccup is transformed by an implied master’s discourse into a willful glitch in relational harmony as an overt demand to be re-consecrated as the one and only object of desire.The film intelligently makes fun of the marital game of negotiation of desire and privilege, using a third party patsy as the pawn in the game.The film makes the most fun of all at the expense of a musical genius whose performance anxiety (caused by his immature narcissism) keeps him from achieving the full potential of his talent to bring success in the eyes of the big Other. His rather primitive defense mechanisms of vulgar disdain, general negativity, compensatory superiority, terrified aloofness, and pitiful temper tantrums—which make him unable to sustain an adult sexual relationship—make him the perfect foil to represent a credible threat to the marriage without him actually being one, which is obvious to the husband as well.Thus, the film portrays a game, not a war, and not a tragedy. But there is a bittersweet sadness to the film, an implicit tragic missed opportunity, which is that none of the game players can make use of the space of freedom they mutually create to shake up their rigid patterns, or to do anything more than repeat those patterns. Growth and transformation do not happen. The opportunity is lost. The ego re-parks itself on Park Avenue and the veils of maya remain in place. But the beauty of the film is that though the veils remain in place for the protagonists, they cannot do so for those in the audience for whom the veils have slyly been unveiled.In what does not happen in this film, which keeps it pegged within the apparent locus of the petty and the pitiful, we see a sublime vision of the future, of the day when the truth can be felt and spoken of the divine love which had until then been hidden behind the egoic maneuvers of the creatures within the diegetic dream, but is revealed as the purpose of the dreamer, the director whose intelligence and love bring ever more spiritually mature dreams into manifestation, until we can actually dream—and be dreamed into—a new Sat Yuga.May this film unveil whatever still needs to fall away so that you can all realize the beyond of even the most beautiful dream worlds: the Supreme Liberation.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/12.png	\N	2019-06-24 17:42:48	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.458955	2025-10-28 15:31:24.458955	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
0db42047-c86d-4b2a-be9f-ab54725cf57c	captain-fantastic-shunyamurti-movie-night-essay	Captain Fantastic	This is our introduction to an extraordinary family of hyper-politically-aware beings with super powers of intelligence, physical prowess, and courage who have left behind the effete civilization of white capitalist Amerikkka, and who have created their own survivalist paradise in the remote mountain forests of Oregon and who live in happy self-sufficiency.	text	gyani	0	\N	\N	Opening setup: A savage tribe of white kids out of Lord of the Flies is hunting a stag. An adolescent boy jumps the unsuspecting deer and does the short work of cutting its throat. The ultra-alpha male-hunter-war chief father comes to finish off the job, slicing open the deer’s chest and pulling out its still-beating heart. He offers it to the son, who eats it. The rite of passage is complete: the boy has become a man. But has he?\nThis is our introduction to an extraordinary family of hyper-politically-aware beings with super powers of intelligence, physical prowess, and courage who have left behind the effete civilization of white capitalist Amerikkka, and who have created their own survivalist paradise in the remote mountain forests of Oregon and who live in happy self-sufficiency.\nExcept for one minor matter, that becomes the black hole of the film’s shadowy underside: the mother of this family of six children is missing. She is hospitalized far away with a mental illness, and news comes one day that she has committed suicide.\nThe life of the wild ones is cracked open, as they feel they must return to the fallen world of capitalist profanity to make sure she is honored properly in death. Thus the clan of super beings hits the road in an old hippie bus to re-encounter the nasty world they (at least the father) had left behind. The patriarch, played vigorously by Viggo Mortenson, as a cross between Charles Manson and Crazy Horse, who flips in mid-film into a self-doubting sad sack and later into a maternalized eunuch for the American dream, succeeds in giving this black comedy its depth of character as well as embodying the crucifixion and demise of the heroic archetype that he embodied. He reiterates the impotence of manhood to change the system.\nThis is indeed a fantastic film—in the sense of over-the-top cartoonish fantasy figures pretending to be real people—a family of genius-level social revolutionaries in fact—living their superior truth in your face, and every moment throwing dynamite in all directions, yet somehow never hitting a live target, never doing more than a striptease of revolution or an empty homage to Buddhism without substance or the slightest inclination to question the nature of reality, cleverly disguised as the aggressive questioning of everything, leaving nothing sacred: The revolution degraded into farcical family cult. And the great joke is that their deity is Noam Chomsky, a pseudo-revolutionary academic figure who seems to attack the system while avoiding dealing with its dark heart, or exposing the hidden truth behind any really relevant event in which consent is manufactured, such as the true nature of the 911 attack.\nExtremely talented and analytically sophisticated screenwriters without political loyalties are among the highest-paid assets of the system in Hollywood. The film industry, especially the major studios, serves the ruling system as one of its most effective tools of ideological capture. All films (and all forms of public art) are political. The best films succeed in hiding their agendas, and even camouflaging them to make the apparent intentions—the bait—seem like the opposite of the hook. In fact, this is what gives the hook its power and allure. That is why skillful screenwriters are paid so well. The problem for Hollywood is that they also want to make money. So they have to satisfy the desires of the very people they want to mind-control and ridicule, while also satisfying the elite rulers of the system by ensuring that the message conforms to the party line. This requires a multi-level approach, full of tacking and twisting, so that no one can pin down exactly what the real subliminal payload contains.\nThe principle of bait-and-hook, bait-and-switch is the prime Machiavellian ruse that provides the mainstay of the mind control operations of governments and corporations and cinematographers throughout the modern period. But in politics proper, it often requires an actual patsy (in addition to the usual paid shills) to pull off the operation. In the recent election of Trump, for example, it was the sincere beliefs of Steve Bannon that gained the candidate his hard-core following, based on such rallying cries as “drain the swamp,” make friends with Russia, pull back from globalist empire and war, and rebuild the infrastructure and the culture of the nation. “Make America great again.” Of course, within a couple of months after victory, Bannon had been fired and removed from the scene, along with all the other true believers. The system’s loyal deep state strategists took over. The cynical stooges of the system filled the power slots. The outraged masses of the winner’s electoral base—preemptively labeled ‘deplorables’—have gone into deeper alienation. But the psy op worked to neutralize dissidence, and all was very carefully stage-managed, with plenty of red herrings and other diversions, like the meme of Russian hacking, Trump as Putin’s stooge, etc., etc. All this is elaborated only to make clear the nature of a feature film as a grand psy op, designed by those who understand how to manipulate emotions, attitudes, and unconscious frames of reference. One should never naively watch a film without understanding that one is being operated upon.\nIn the same way, we have been operated upon in and since childhood—and one of the chief functions of the operation was to cripple our ability to think clearly and act decisively, powerfully, and accurately—at least in certain key areas of life.\nThe uniqueness of this historic moment is that the ruling system no longer—since 911—feels the need to hide its technique from people. The system, by getting away with such an obvious traitorous false flag deception, has convinced itself that it can now do anything, commit any atrocity, without having to deal with an uprising in the ranks. The sheeple have become so docile that one need not hide one’s tracks. The control of the mainstream media, of nearly all the public voices, even those of the apparent opposition—like Noam Chomsky, Alex Jones, or Amy Goodman—and the willingness to use straight intimidation, cyber attacks, and termination by extreme prejudice of troublemakers who get too tiresome—makes the necessity of precise prestidigitation obsolete. Secret techniques can be revealed—even flaunted—and the sheeple are too dumbed down, frightened and impotent to threaten the mighty Wurlitzer, the giant steamroller of the system, from paving over truth with its bloody Orwellian discourse and no ears are left who dare to hear a contrarian word.\nThe film we are to be worked over by this evening falls into the category of major ideological snare, and might even be deserving of being named best of breed in these latter degraded days before the fall of Rome-on-the-Potomac. The screenwriter, Matt Ross, is clearly intelligent, well read, with a superiority complex. And he brags about it, by making his protagonists all larger than life in cerebral matters, as well as in levels of physical stamina, strength, and survivalist skills that turn the film into a cartoon—and for that reason take some of the sting out of its poison load as well as give him plausible deniability as to the political intentions of this “family entertainment”.\nThe screenplay is more intent on playing “Dare” with the audience—how far will they go, how much truth will they speak, how honestly will they address a child’s questions about human sexuality, for example—and they make it seem like there are no limits, but then it turns out that this was all another deception, and the point of the film is very conventional, safe and sentimental—not to mention, supportive of the system—after all. These people are not really concerned with living out Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution. All they want is to kiss a girl, play video games and rock music and wear nike shoes like other kids, and enjoy junk food and junk thought. “Dare” is the bait, making those who dare into the obvious heroes. But then comes the hook: the chief father hero is cruel, narcissistic, psychopathic, a child abuser, an amoral criminal, a danger to his children. He is clearly unhinged, just like his late wife, who committed suicide—and who, it unfolds, may just have been driven over the edge by the hero himself. And if the hero is really a villain, or criminally insane, then all his daring beliefs and attitudes and dangerous actions are suddenly not about freedom and speaking truth to power, but simply the means of indoctrinating his helpless captive clan into his sick weird paranoid leftist survivalist nihilist cult fantasy.\nThe screenwriter even reveals the formula of the film within one of its well-crafted scenes. The father demands that his daughter express her critical response to the novel she is reading, which happens to be Lolita. She expresses how the writer (Nabokov), by employing first-person narration filled with moving poetic expressions of romantic love, makes one empathize with the protagonist, even though the character is engaged in an unwholesome pedophilic relationship with an underage girl. This creates a bipolar un-decidable oscillation in the thinking/feeling functions of the reader that obscures moral clarity.This film has a slightly different agenda from that perverse novel, however. And right after the protagonist father of the film is forced to see himself from a mainstream perspective of normal capitalist values—as a result of the betrayal of two of his sons who openly desire to leave him for what the urban materialist and academic world can offer—the camera focuses on the father dealing with his defeat, the collapse of his world, the letting go of custody of his children, the loneliness of long-distance driving back to his empty forest camp in his decrepit bus, feeling he has failed everyone and must carry the burden of being a pitiful pariah whose egocentric self-inflation deserved to suffer such an ignominious fall. Here we get the hook. But we are quickly anesthetized and the hypnotic suggestion is forgotten (and thus lodged more powerfully as a splinter in the mind), as the film suddenly falls into cartoon mode again, through another howling deus ex machina, when it turns out the kids have secretly run away with him as well, and have been hiding in the bus all along. As if the bus had some hidden basement where they were sitting for hours—as if the bus were the unconscious mind that never leaves its child self behind.The “dare” mentality reaches its apotheosis when the family stoops to engaging in nocturnal grave robbing (and of course the cemetery has no night watchman to halt the madness) to steal back the mother’s corpse to fulfill her last wishes of cremation. This is followed by a gruesome scene of necrophilic nuzzling with the mother’s corpse, again cartoonishly denying what the real condition of a cadaver a week after death would look and smell like. The film resolutely prostrates again to the lower death drive.But there is no trace of spiritual relationship to consciousness by any member of the family, as the mother’s Buddhist commitment would seem to demand. Buddhism is just an exotic label for nihilism, for flushing her body’s ashes down the toilet. Is it not Buddhism itself that is being flushed down the memory hole? And did not the woman have to die because there was no place for the feminine—certainly not the divine feminine posited by the archetype of the Buddhist goddess, whether Tara or Quan Yin—within the dreary bloodstained phallic cult of macho survivalism purveyed by the father, that turned his daughters into hardened steel Amazons and when necessary into acrobatic cat burglars. And when the family relate in their signature mode, it is not about achieving liberation from a stultifying system, but just empty and pointless aggression against authority: “Stick it to the Man.” In terms of their political vision, there is no there there. And that is the real poison on the hook. Once again, TINA rules. There Is No Alternative. And so the idealistic revolution that will unveil the next age of humanity living by the legitimate authority of divine right disintegrates into the same dead end of history as predicted by all the pundits: the invincible capitalist materialist regime wins again, against these upstart fanatics who think they can escape from its grip. No, the system always wins.In other words, to satisfy Hollywood, the film must end in a tame anti-climactic compromise formation, in which, in this case, the family of former savages moves into a suburban home, the once-continentally-striding war bus is now a shipwrecked chicken coop, and the once-fearsome phallic Father has morphed into the soft new Mommy, making breakfast for the kids and eating cereal and milk that he had once disdained as not being real food. Their project of radical freedom ends not with a bang or a war whoop but a contented burp and a nostalgic whimper. And yet there is one note of real transcendence: that salvific moment at the burning of the mother’s body when the girls take the lead and sing out their heart-leaping song of love that redeems them all. Yet it is that very victory of undying love that leads to the clan’s domestication.All this results from accepting the premises of the system, which predetermine that only the system is truly attuned to the needs of the human ego. And the film never asks if there is any consciousness beyond the ego. It unquestioningly accepts the limits of language, of cause and effect, of pre-quantum thinking, with no possibility of divine intervention, other-dimensional realities intersecting with the phenomenal plane, the de-collapse of the quantum wave function, or a coherent signal from beyond that could transmute the planetary field of morphic resonance. In other words, the film rejects the magic potency promised by quantum Buddhist understanding to those who enter deeply enough into the secret interior of pure awareness. The script remains resolutely on the surface of imaginary existence. The symbolic is only a cardboard backdrop for cheap political expediency. And there is no Real except dead bodies, whether of deer or mothers, and we are to live within the lonely oscillation of life and death, without complaint or interest in what may lie beyond the matrix.May your viewing of this film empower you to go beyond all limits—and become the true Captains Fantastic—not to mention avatars and angels, magi and miracle-makers, goddesses and gods—that the system cannot even imagine could appear and lead the true celestial revolution that the Buddha Mind is generating—and that is already underway.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/13.png	\N	2019-06-21 18:06:17	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.461426	2025-10-28 15:31:24.461426	[]	[]	["D1kH4OMIOMc"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

It is a coming-of-age story of two boys in Brooklyn during the Second World War. One boy, Reuven, is a modern orthodox Jew. The other, Danny, is an ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jew, the son of the sect’s tzaddik. They live in two different culture worlds, even though both study the Talmud and say the same prayers.\nThe film gets the Hasidic clothing right, and the sidelocks and beards. But there the psycho-cultural realism ends. The tzaddik is depicted as a shrill, one-dimensional, somewhat sadistic leader lacking in authentic wisdom. There is little mention of the Kabbalah. The rebbe’s teachings are idiotic. Danny is depicted as a culturally and intellectually deprived genius, who secretly goes to the public library to discover Freud and other modern secular thinkers. But in reality, Danny would have had many things to say back to Freud, he would not have simply absorbed what he read without being able to call upon the esoteric Jewish wisdom he would have been learning in his Hasidic studies to critique the propositions of psychoanalysis.\nThe film portrays Danny’s decision to attend a secular university to study psychology as some radical move that threatens his place in his Hasidic lineage and that is close to heresy. But many Hasidic men have studied in secular schools and fields. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, for example, had an engineering degree from the Sorbonne. So Danny’s decision is not nearly as controversial as the film plays it to be. Nor is his having a Jewish friend outside the sect.\nThe main conflict erupts when Reuven’s father is revealed as a Zionist, and Danny’s father comes across as a hysterical anti-Zionist, who, however, drops his antagonism to Zionism once the UN vote makes Israel a reality. That, too, would not likely have happened.\nBut despite these failings, the film sincerely portrays a friendship that overcomes egoic and social obstacles and shows how two boys navigate the irrational world they have inherited to become men—self-reinventing, independently thinking, and decisively acting, real men.\nReuven has to face the unavailability of a desirable young Hasidic woman, while he tempts Danny with the availability of erotic experience in the secular world, ranging from the examination of the female nude in an art museum to the graphic sexuality of a Hollywood film to the reality of desirous females in a promiscuous culture with few limits on the pursuit of sensual gratification.\nThis ability to separate from their families’ limited values and horizons to create their own destinies, to accept each other in their differences, and to value those differences rather than try to convert the other to another way of life—but at the same time to introduce each other to what each is missing in his own lifestyle—brings challenges and growth, the recognition of limits and the need to make choices that involve sacrifice—and finally to separate without sadness, but with deep feeling that cannot be described with any clichés.\nThe film makes up for its flaws with its profound faithfulness to the young men’s own faithfulness to Truth, and their refusal to settle for comfort or conventionality. At the same time, it portrays two fathers who likewise try to live their lives as truthfully and as generously and egolessly as possible, while struggling with the impossible task of providing the symbolic guidance their sons will need to face a rapidly changing world, which only the signifier of Jewishness enables them to make sense of. The film also depicts the stunted social roles of women and their forced separation from the intellectual milieu that the men are allowed to explore. By conveniently making Reuven’s father a widower, the film avoided confronting the similar tensions of women in the more secular social world of orthodox non-Hasidic Jews.\nThe Chosen succeeds in portraying the rite of passage from boyhood to manhood in a time in which the patriarchy, and its concept of manhood, is on the brink of collapse. It is a time that will soon reveal the naivete of idealistic Zionists, as well as of orthodox psychoanalysts. One gets the sense that these two men will be able to cope with those tectonic shifts as well.\nI hope the film holds your interest and provokes lively discussion of its themes. It did succeed in portraying a bit of the flavor of that period of my own life in which I, like Reuven, peered into the world of the Brooklyn Hasidim.\nNamaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/14.png	\N	2019-06-18 15:15:44	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.464614	2025-10-28 15:31:24.464614	[]	[]	["RAMz8_MoqrM"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The film is perhaps even more about the children, especially the tomboy daughter, Scout, and how she gradually grows into her femininity, keeping alive the father’s invincible courage and intelligence. The film depicts a North American culture that is long gone, and probably was never quite like it is depicted here. The racism and apartheid is a structural reality, and the black folk are all too cowed to dare raise a protest, even in the face of obvious and outrageous injustice. They depend on the help of the one white man with the courage to honor truth over racial collusion.One wonders if it was necessary to make Finch a widower. Would it have been possible for him to be the same powerful symbolic figure if he had to contend with a wife as well? Or would her own way of protecting the children have produced arguments and indecisiveness on his part? Could a couple relationship in the modern context permit the embodiment of symbolic leadership in a father? Certainly nowadays such a unified family field of higher order is rarely to be known.This film demonstrates the lost ideal of what a man should be, and how he should function in the world. It answers the question of what is a real adult. It is a very moving experience to witness such a being in action. May you learn much from this masterpiece.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/15.png	\N	2019-06-15 15:15:50	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.466251	2025-10-28 15:31:24.466251	[]	[]	["KR7loA_oziY"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The conquest of that island against determined defense by the Japanese forces was likely the turning point of that war in the Pacific and the establishment of the U.S. as a global empire.I would call this a nature film. A film about the sublime beauty of Nature, a beauty that includes the activity of natural creatures known as soldiers engaged in capturing territory through sheer savage destructiveness, mass murder, the horror of unrestrained blood lust in the service of a soulless power, human organization dedicated to domination of the world. Malick reveals the full spectrum of the impacts of Real One [the state of consciousness that is pre-symbolic, immersed in the sensorium punctuated by chaotic affect that allows no distancing], his characters oscillating from joy and bodily pleasure to total dread, trauma, psychosis, the agony of dying in unbearable pain, horror, despair, and the ultimate shock of awakening at the moment of physical extinction. There are also more subtle encounters revealing the gut-wrenching moment of betrayal of love, of betrayal of life itself in the name of victory. But at every moment the demonic is superposed with the presence of a greater intelligence, an all-encompassing beauty, a hidden power of goodness that bides its time in order to work its miraculous ongoing transformation of life in the midst of death and despair, of meaningless torment inflected with glory.The film develops its own imagistic grammar, its own delivery of singularities, instants of timeless affcepts, interweaving percepts of blood and mutilation with the affect of utter horror and dismay combined with the uncanny presence of non-human eyes perceiving all with dispassion, and glints of light in the magnificent trees pointing to supernal salvation—and all wrapped in the concepts flowing through otherworldly voiceovers that at times seem like the voice of rationality, at other times that of conscience, and occasionally the voice of a soul, or even perhaps the voice of the Ordainer.Analogues between soldiers as alligators, efficient predatory machines, and of death in the form of black bats, of precognition of fate in the form of an owl’s wise visage, and wounding in battle accompanied by the torment of an injured bird. The film is profound visual poetry. It is the story of consciousness itself, trapped by the orders of the Other, gradually awakening from the sleep of herd behavior to the recognition of the lie, the great deception wreaked by power structures to recruit men to die for illusions. But in this film, the awakening is not complete. It is a work in progress.It is a work that the film indicates that we must complete. We are all engaged in the same war, the war of the liberation of consciousness from evil structures of domination. It is a war in which our only weapon is consciousness itself—in the form of compassion and transcendence.At this moment in history, the world is on the brink of witnessing another war in the Pacific, this one between the U.S. empire and China. It will likely become the final world war. And this time, even Nature may not survive. It is only that supernatural spark, that produces love, heroism under fire, and greatness in the midst of degradation; it is only the realization of the power of pure Presence to overcome all limitations of space and time, energy and matter, the laws of Nature Herself, in full surrender to the Supreme Source of this cosmos, that has a chance of saving us all from endless perdition.It must be the wager of those who seek to give life another chance, to save their own Spirit from final darkness and disseminate a holy field of morphic resonance that conquers the noosphere of our planet that can overthrow the reign of evil and bring about the victory of Heaven’s Kingdom. Our destiny is in our own minds, if only we will take the leap beyond the thin red line that separates the ego from God.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/16.png	\N	2019-06-12 15:15:24	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.46775	2025-10-28 15:31:24.46775	[]	[]	["mKl5_OxKBn8"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The massive increase of cases of radiation sickness and genetic mutation throughout Japan are being censored. The Japanese people are in denial of the grave situation they are in, and pretending everything is under control, even though it is not; nor do they have a clue how to resolve the catastrophe. Yet they go on as if all is normal, planning to host the next Olympics, psychotically cut off from the mortal wound that is destroying their country and slowly but surely the entire ecosystem of marine life and via the prevailing winds and ocean currents, killing off the planetary web of life as a whole.\nBut this film has no pretensions of commenting on any larger social situations or engaging in cultural critique. It is a miniature. The focus is on the random momentary intersection of two lives that in no other circumstance but the sharing of a strange hiatus in a fancy hotel for jet-lagged foreigners in a chic part of Tokyo, a moment in time between planes, a liminal moment in which normal routines are in abeyance, would ever come together and try to click.\nThe man, played by Bill Murray, is old enough to be the father of the bored young woman, played by Scarlett Johansson—which is perhaps the point, that only such a platonic fatherly relationship can still be meaningful in a world of promiscuous amorality. What both thirst for is not another sex partner, but an encounter with an authentic Other. They need to be jolted out of the deadness of their flat one-dimensional pointless lives, which cannot be achieved by yet another routine robotic copulation that is the expected trajectory of desire. They yearn subliminally for a something more, a je ne se qua, than an objectifying flesh-focused non-relation based on the sex drive, that soon—once lust is exhausted—inevitably morphs into ennui and melancholia, or obsessive focus on work, children, or other forms of compulsive jouissance. They have both been there, done that. And they are done.\nThe man is in a state of numb depersonalization. He is an estranged husband, a father of several difficult children whose wife no longer has time or interest in him except as a cardboard placeholder in the family system. He is a has-been movie star now reduced to making commercials for whiskey and talk show appearances in far flung parts of the world that still show his old films on TV. He knows he is past his shelf life, his body is junk, and he has nothing to offer a younger generation of fast moving hustlers on the make. The old warhorse is only going through the motions of living. He is a relic from a lost world, on display like a reservation Indian touring in a wild-west show.\nAnd she is in the same situation, going through her midlife crisis while still in her early 20s. The ravages of time are accelerating, and now life is lost before it can even begin. Existence has become an empty promise that is withdrawn at the very moment of coming of age.\nThe sad energy of their abandonment despair draws the two together, not for a sexual fling, but for the rare opportunity of sharing emptiness, of gleaning and offering a glow of meaning and recognition from one unbearably lonely heart to another. He may be hoping to recapture a time when conversation still had a semblance of depth, while she knows no meeting of minds that is not made of clichés from a canned monologue emitted by a cd in a headset.\nBut for a moment the two are confronted with a refuge, in the oasis of each other’s eyes, where they can enter a new paradigm of relationality, in which they can both accept the nothingness that makes them both the same, when there is no script nor expectation, and both are allowed to be open to listening and trying to understand another being from a different world, of a different gender, with different challenges, and with nothing at stake but truth. They both realize this will end in an instant, but that fact opens the portal to the labyrinth of kairos time, beneath the highway of morbid chronologic leading to demise and in any case already dead. They take this detour into the now together, learning jerkily to mobilize the atrophied capacity for empathy to bring their souls to life, if only for this one passing yet eternal leap into the Real.\nBut the tragic inability to understand each other, nor the other that is the ego itself—whose signifiers are unavoidably lost in translation—or to be able to offer any medicine for healing the lostness of the egoic facade in an empty life and world that constitute its own reflection, lead finally to the film’s dead end, in which the tick of time returns, and they are tossed by temporality back into the grinding fate of death on the installment plan. And the film loses its nerve here, its clarity fails, it is literally lost for words. There is a final scene, a heroic burst of energy in a run for a last hug, but the man’s last whispered words to his sweet companion must remain hidden, they must be lost without translation, because their only significance is the fact of their being uttered, and being utterly without consequence, yet paradoxically constituting the most honorable and meaningful communication in both their lives, for the simple but noble reason that they were faithful to the ecstatic significance of the event. They did not defile each other as sexual objects, but treated one another as true beings of pure consciousness, whose connection is in the timeless formlessness of consciousness itself, and whose meeting represents their upper death drive striving to rise above the ego in the recognition of a unity that transcends all differences and all need for ongoing meetings within the limited and unreal realm of time and space. Something did happen between them, but it happened not in Tokyo, but in the Heart of the Second Real—the Real of Love.Not that Murray had transcended the lower chakras. In fact, he does have a night of sexual activity with the singer in the hotel lounge where the main action of the film takes place. But it is a mere side scene, a pro forma exchange of business cards with another performance artist who is also past her prime. The real affair is happening two assemblage points higher, in another tower of song that only surrendering souls can sing in the silence of solitude. But the sexual interlude does lead to confusion and backlash when Scarlett finds out, and must figure out that in this more refined frame of reference there was no infidelity, only a guarding of the space they shared by his spilling his seeds of sorrow elsewhere, so that no impulse toward corporal coupling would intrude on their need for a nexus of noetic nullification of all that they had known of personal reality.This film was chosen to be shown this evening with much hesitation, because it does have some quick flashes of semi-nudity in a sad and seedy strip club, but rather than being erotic, the scene reveals the vulgarity and ugliness of turning the sacred beauty of the human form into an object of perverted lust. Those who live secluded from the degraded kali yuga world in a remote ashram, yet who still harbor fantasies of returning to that defiling bardo of sexual stimulation, alcoholic haze, tobacco, and drugs; hanging onto the dream of performing as musicians in a high end hotel lounge band; or making it big in some prestigious career like photography or film; or who cling to the rescue fantasy of making some love connection that would bring wholeness and the end of egoic suffering, may just be cured of such delusions by ingesting the actual horror of such a barren desolation of life marooned in the desert of Real One, as depicted in this honest gem of a film with a vital message of the urgency of true transcendence.Without a community of fellow pilgrims seeking the light of divine love, or the practice of transformation and discovery of authentic Being—Being that has no place in kali yuga, no fertile ground to flourish in—the possibility of creating and sustaining a life of authenticity and spiritual fulfillment is nil. Those who have found their way to a sacred life focused on the tao of divinization of consciousness may count their blessings after watching this depressing yet noble film that forces the viewer to recognize what is missing from postmodern civilization, and that can only appear in the cracks of time when a flash of the true light of love can momentarily become visible, as it does by gazing at this cinematic diamond for a sparkling glimpse of the naked urge to find a higher Real.\nNamaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/17.png	\N	2019-06-09 15:15:19	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.469226	2025-10-28 15:31:24.469226	[]	[]	["W6iVPCRflQM", "vGvDCmuDKKE"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

Think of Russian classical music, of her great operatic singers and styles. Russian art—from ancient to postmodern; her classic architecture, cooking; and of course the Russian dance, especially ballet; all the arts, with such long histories and movements and nuanced creativity. And let us include Russian film, from Eisenstein to Tarkovsky—a unique approach to cinema has developed in Russia. And let us not forget her greatness in the field of chess. No country has produced so many brilliant grandmasters as Russia. And now there is greatness in her technological achievements, her military precision, and the unrivalled statesmanship of her current leaders on the stage of global politics.But above all, in the field of writing, there is no national literature that compares in epic sensitivity and exalted human courage combined with naive idiocy and compassion with that of Russia, with its long list of profound poetic and novelistic storytelling geniuses, including such well known names as Dostoevsky, Turgenyev, Pushkin, Gogol, Bunin, and Tolstoy up to Solzhenitsyn—and too many more lesser known stars in her galaxies of great writers to list without seeming to go on forever.But in the field of drama, Chekhov stands alone. And without Chekhov there could have been no Stanislavsky, who required such a dramatic challenge to expression in order to elaborate his system as an approach to developing the dramatic persona, and without Stanislavsky, there could have been no adequate way to interpret theatrically the multidimensional inwardness of the characters immortalized by Chekhov. His plays are the essence of meaningmoreness.In Uncle Vanya, we see with crystal clarity how an ego cannot cope with the Real of existence and flees, when possible, into the Imaginary. Those who are able to command the desire of the Other may be able to face the barren truth of “il n’y a pas de rapport sexuel” but generally not without agony and alcohol, and in the best of cases through a symbolic sublimation and secession from the sensuous realm into ethical or religious catharsis, and accession to the higher Real of divine presence and love.In great theatre, such as this dramatic work, an actor can express the longings of the soul in the elocution of soliloquy. Even when the longing for the peace of posthumous rest or the ecstasies of spiritual beatitude are limited to conventional credo or an un-internalized aspiration or idealization not fully believed, the compensations offered by the very act of self-reflection, magnified onstage by the actor’s gaze into infinity while speaking of the ungraspable sublime of God’s embrace, offers the intense otherworldliness of even the most mundane ego in its moments of withdrawal into its yet unbroken soul—a species of moment no longer known to the postmodern ego whose deficit of attention can no longer sustain such moments of interior focus long enough to reach the stillness that enables life to endure the vacillations and vapidity of boredom in a dying culture with no remaining resources of fidelity from which to drink.In the dying embers of a great culture, entombed in the once-lively country estate of a clan now in ruins, whose own patriarch is nothing but a disturbance to the remnants of a once-flourishing clan, and to himself, whose intellectuality is mere vanity, and whose wife has no love to offer, and whose beauty is for naught; courted by a doctor whose abilities are in grave doubt; shadowed by a spinster whose goodness is unrequited; and all helplessly witnessed by the hysteric Vanya, who cannot shoot straight when he finally decides to act, and cannot even carry through a successful suicide.Chekhov reveals the ego to itself, in all the glory of its ineptitude, its ironic and clownish innocence, its lack of any capacity to see beyond its illusory consciousness and perceive God’s sense of humor and the kingdom of heaven still shimmering for those with third eye open enough to see, and audible in the pitch of sound that opens and closes this dreamworld reminiscent of the olden days, still kept barely alive by the aging servants, the strumming of a guitar which triggers the memory of the cossack dancing of real men to the quivering strings and the eternal music of the Tatar balalaika.Namaste,Shunyamurti	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/18.png	\N	2019-06-06 15:15:19	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.470635	2025-10-28 15:31:24.470635	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]

The word Easter does not appear in the Bible, of course, because it is simply a misspelling of the name Ishtar, the Goddess of Babylon (now known as Iraq). It is more than coincidental that at this late hour of Kali Yuga, Christendom should return to Babylon, albeit unconsciously, to confront its own spiritual roots. Some would even say Ishtar has been crucified by Christendom, and now is rising up once again.The Goddess Ishtar long predated both Hebrew and Christian theologies. She is the ultimate goddess, of dense and many-layered symbolism, and her influence reaches secretly across the globe. Let us try to put together the puzzle Ishtar represents.First, of course, we must refer to the obvious patriarchalization of religious imagery which led to the aphanisis, or disappearing, of the goddess from Christian thinking. Although the feminine element slips back in with the later ascension of Mary, the goddess remains present only in such traces as the giving of the holiest day in the Christian calendar the name Ishtar.In one of the basic mythical narratives, Ishtar, the Queen of Heaven, travels to the underworld. At each of the Seven Gates, she has to remove one part of her attire, starting with her crown. As she does this, she loses her power. She is captured by the Evil Goddess of the Underworld, Erish-Kegal. She ends up naked and bleeding, draped over a tree. The Father God, Anu, works to rescue Ishtar by fashioning two Elementals, the Water of Life and the Clay of Life. The two Elementals cleverly work their way down through the Seven Gates, and sprinkle the Water and Clay of Life upon Ishtar. This enables her to climb back up the Seven Rungs of the Ladder of Light, retrieving her attire and her power, to become Queen of Heaven once again.One can easily perceive in this narrative the structure of the chakras and their attendant assemblage points. In other words, our infinite consciousness has descended from its fullness of light and wisdom down to the lowest, most neurotic and psychotic, levels of ego. The image of being naked and bleeding, draped over a tree, is of course the image of Christ on the cross. The water of life is also familiar to Christian mythology, that of the baptism. The combination of water and clay refers to a principle of the ancient Shiite science of al-kimia, known in the West as alchemy. The principle is known famously in Latin as “Solve et Coagula.” This refers to the capacity to dissolve, or de-crystallize, the ego structure and coagulate, or re-crystallize it, at a higher assemblage point, a higher frequency and level of coherence.Ishtar’s losing of her clothing and her crown on the downward path into ego-consciousness, and her regaining of that attire on the upward journey is still memorialized in the old Christian superstition of wearing something new on Easter. A new garment worn on this day would bring good luck through the coming year. The birds would punish those who wore old attire by dropping decorations on them from the air. In fact, the Easter Parade grew out of the old beliefs about dressing up in new clothing. This grand event provided a chance to be seen wearing the latest fashions and fads. The elegant ritual reinforced social hierarchies through conspicuous displays of wealth and taste.Of course, all this is simply an egoic distortion of the real meaning of the clothes. They represent the virtues and capacities of consciousness (siddhis) that are gained as the lower drives and emotions are sublimated on the inner journey of Self realization.In a second, dualist version of the myth, Ishtar went to the underworld to rescue her son-lover Tammuz. The Descent into Hell took three days. During this time there was sterility and a suspension of sexual activities over the whole earth. It culminated in the Day of Joy, when Tammuz was returned to life, which began the new year.The Christ myth can be seen clearly here, even Christ’s three-day journey into Hell was taken from this mytheme. Of course, we would understand it to refer to the Hell of the unconscious mind of the ego. By descending into our own inner Hell and rescuing the lost sparks of consciousness trapped down there, we may accomplish the great task of redeeming ourselves from unconsciousness, and attaining re-divinization. The Day of Joy refers to the moment when this re-divinization has occurred planet-wide, ushering in an era we call Sat Yuga, a new Golden Age. We can also see in this structure the paradigm of spiritual renunciation, in which penitents take vows of chastity, until they no longer identify with body or name and their energy of desire has been raised from an obsession with sex to a one-pointed desire for union with the Supreme Being.Ishtar is the goddess of many names. She is also known as Astarte. The word “star” derives from her name, and she is said to be a star, sometimes Sirius and other times that of Venus. In her form of morning star, she is the goddess of war and carnage, and as the evening star, the goddess of love and bliss. In other words, her coming represents the moment of transition between Kali Yuga and Sat Yuga. As such, she is also the goddess who brings peace, and in that capacity has been called Semiramis (the one who holds the olive branch, in other words, the dove) and later the Roman goddess Columba (whom we have already talked about in other teachings). In early Semitic myths, she is referred to as Adon, the Lord, which evolved into Athon, and in Greek became both Adonis and Athena. In Christianity, of course, she was transfigured from Adon to Madonna.In Hebrew mythology, she is the Shekhinah, the Holy Spirit. She is also the “beloved” of the Song of Songs, is on the one hand the harlot of the gods (the “hierodule of heaven,” Belit, the Black One, known as Kali in India), but on the other hand she is the mother and virgin. She is spoken of as the “virgin womb of Chaos.” In pre-Hebrew Canaanite mythology, her icon is the Tree, and her name is Asherah. In Assyria, she becomes Inanna, and later Estera, and is re-introduced into Jewish mythology as Queen Esther. In Norse mythology, she is called Freya, and is the goddess celebrated on Good Friday.We could go on a long time naming all her avatars in every culture, from the German goddess Hertha to the Chinese Heavenly Queen Shing Mu. You can find her everywhere. Moreover, this most shape-shifting goddess is present in a different form at every level of consciousness. In fact, she is the earliest representation of the Supreme Being in all the modifications, crystallizations, and contractions of Being from the Absolute to matter to the finite persona.Babylonian scriptures called her the Light of the World, Lord and Leader of Hosts, Opener of the Womb, Righteous Judge, Lawgiver, Goddess of Goddesses, Bestower of Strength, Framer of All Decrees, Lady of Victory, and Forgiver of Sins. Much of the liturgical flattery addressed to God in the Old Testament was taken directly from Babylonian prayers to Ishtar.At the highest level, Chakra Seven, Ishtar is the Great Nothingness, the Void, the womb of the All, and is referred to as Ashura. In India, this state of transfinite potency is referred to as Brahman. She is also known as the Goddess of the Gaze, and is pictured as the All-Seeing Eye at the top of the pyramid that represents in freemasonry the descent of Spirit.At Chakra Six, she is the lover of God. In India, at this level she is known as Isi and her divine lover is Ishwara. In another tradition, the same couple is referred to as Shakti and Shiva. She is now the radiant light of the Star of luminous awareness. In Egypt, of course, she is famous as Isis, and she descends to recover the scattered pieces of the body of her divine lover Osiris. In Tibet, Ishtar changed her name to Tara, and she took on further names in China and Japan, always as the Queen of Heaven, and the Lady (Madonna) of the Great Lord. She is also, among other things, the goddess of the Sun.As she descends to Chakra Five, she enters the Cosmic Egg, the archetypal origin of all form, from which she will be reborn into the Earthly plane. Here she takes the name Sophia, and is renowned as the goddess of wisdom. And of course the egg symbolism has remained with us in the form of the Easter egg. Her name Estera later took on the meaning of estrus (ovulation) and is present in the hormone Estrogen. In Latin countries, she has evolved into the piñata, which is often made in the form of a star, that is whacked open (an allusion to the higher purpose of karma and suffering, not to mention such processes of dharma combat as psychoanalysis) to reveal its treasures.At Chakra Four, she incarnates as both Athena and Aphrodite. She is the union of divine love and law. In Egypt, she also gives birth to Time (her son/lover is named Horus, from whom we have the hours). In Greece, she can also be recognized in the myth of Persephone, the beautiful virgin goddess who is ravished by Hades, the lord of Hell, yet who remains a virgin (“thou still unravished bride of Time”), and thereafter spends half her life in the underworld and half in the upper regions with her mother, Demeter. This myth, of course refers to the soul’s wandering between truth and illusion, the journey through Time from Sat Yuga to Kali Yuga and back again. She can be seen in yet another form in the Indian epic Ramayana as Sita, the pure wife of god Rama. She is abducted by the great demon Ravana and rescued with the help of the divine monkey Hanuman. In other words, human nature oscillates between sublime and bestial, the soul belongs to God part of the time and to the Devil the other part.When she enters the lower levels of the labyrinth, her star changes. She is no longer Venus, the goddess of divine love, but Sirius, the Dog Star. She becomes the estrus, and, as with a bitch in heat, she drives the male dogs into a frenzy. This frenzy, the quest to be top dog, is the energy of Chakra Three. In Chakra Two, she becomes the sexual drive itself, the Whore of Babylon, and in Chakra One she enters the frozen form of total inertia and unconsciousness, the womb of death.The entire play of consciousness is revealed in the archetypal imagery of Ishtar. She has completed her descent. The Cosmic Dream has reached its final stop, the lowest depths of Hell. Now is the moment of Ishtar’s rise. At Chakra One, she incarnates as the Kundalini serpent, the energy of self-awareness that rises through all the chakras, breaking through the seven Veils of Maya to regain the majesty of pure Spirit.Ishtar is not just a myth, nor is she someone else. Ishtar is your Self. The myth is your story, an awesome and miraculous story that is about to unfold in ways you never imagined.Here at the Sat Yoga Institute, we wish you a truly Happy Ishtar Sun Day.Namaste,Shunyamurti\nTopics covered in this teaching:\nMythology	https://www.members.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/1-2.jpg	\N	2019-02-08 17:51:13	essay	\N	0	2025-10-28 15:31:24.4729	2025-10-28 15:31:24.4729	[]	[]	[]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]
