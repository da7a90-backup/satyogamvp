And isn\u2019t the definition of the ego, simply consciousness captured in the gaze of an other?And therefore, liberation can only be the recognition that there is another other, in whose gaze you live. Beyond the gaze of any particular other, is the archetype of otherness itself. But can otherness ever be itself?.",

And as it gets closer to the light, its love grows in accord with its fear, and the love and the fear become one, and at some point the moth cannot live without becoming one with the flame. And in that moment that the moth enters the flame and that its wings are set on fire, and its whole body is taken over by the combustion of the flame\u2014at that moment\u2014just for one instant\u2014the moth knows what it is to be the flame.

    "description": "\u201cOur natural state is pure awareness and absolute purity of mind and heart, and thus a state of love-filled joy. But we are only in that state if we are in the Real Self. And the problem for human consciousness is that a false self has intervened to disconnect our consciousness from the Real Self. And so we must learn to recognize the Real Self. And it\u2019s easy to do because the Real Self differs from the false self in one essential way; the Real Self is non-arising. Any self that arises as an object, as a sense of being a body in the world, as having emotions, intentions, agendas, and relations in duality with others, is the false self. The Real Self is non-arising, and from the perspective from the false self, then, the Real Self does not exist because it doesn\u2019t arise, it\u2019s unborn, it\u2019s unmanifest. But what the Real Self knows is that it\u2019s that which arises that does not really exist; it\u2019s not real because it\u2019s fleeting, it\u2019s impermanent, it\u2019s in constant change, and it\u2019s constantly fragmented, different emotions, different attitudes, different thoughts, contradictory, conflicting, feeling, and cognition states; whereas the Real Self that\u2019s non-arising is eternal, unchanging, immutable \u2014 untouched by the chaos of the false self.\u201d",

Never let that light go out. That light will itself dissolve the ego and its sufferings, and its narcissism and its lack of understanding of the Real, and the flame itself will do the work, the flame itself will inspire the thoughts in the mind that will come as gifts to oneself and the world, the flame itself will give the power for the physical labor, the flame itself will create the love and the unity.

We serve through being simple, through living simply without unnecessary and ostentatious accumulations of things, we live with the accurate necessity that diminishes our footprint on this planet to the minimal so that all can survive in the best way possible. The more simply we can each live here at Arunachala, the more yogis can live here at Arunachala and be fed and housed etc. But simplicity has a purifying dimension to it, regardless to your way of life or where you live\u2026",

Because Seva is not simply work, it\u2019s not about being a workaholic, that is not service and in fact those who have workaholic tendencies, their service is to do nothing. There has to be a balance, because often if you are a workaholic means you are running away from yourself. Rather than serving God, you are running away from God\u2026 under the guise of serving God, and it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t do that. The action must be balanced with the meditation.

The ego is a state of hypnosis, a self-reinforcing hypnosis through the suggestions that the ego is constantly filling your mind with. That is why we say, at the end of every meditation, the words Aum, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti. The word Shanti means both peace and silence and it is said three times because the triple silence is necessary to shift the energy field. The triple silence\u2026 of outer silence, no intention of speaking to an other, the silence of the mind, in which there is no inner speaking between fragments of the ego or superego, and the Ultimate Supreme Silence of the Presence of the Supreme Self. It is when all those three levels are in alignment that the energy field shifts.",

There really is no experience and imperience, it only seems that way because language makes it so, and we buy into the illusion of thoughts as if they were real, when they are utterly unreal. It is language that has split the Self from God, has split humanity from Nature, has split each of us from each other, has created all the conflict and the wars and competitions, and the desire to create bigger and bigger weapons to defend this imaginary being against that imaginary being, and in the process devastating what is real.

It is the yoga of Love. And bhakti yoga must never become a separate yoga, because it is non-separation. As soon as it becomes some separate specialized form, it becomes reduced to rituals and ceremonies and mantras and chanting and holding hands and hugging and that sort of thing, and the real meaning of the yoga of Love is lost. The yoga of Love is the true esoteric yoga, the most esoteric of all. Without the yoga of Love, there is no raja yoga, it is an empty, futile, boring exercise in concentration, it is praja yoga, not raja yoga. Raja is the king, praja is the subject. We don\u2019t want to do the yoga of subjects, begging for crumbs from the king. This is a kingdom of Love. (Event: Divine Love is Real Retreat)",

It begins usually with serenity, and that deepens into a very deep sense of peace and well-being; then, happiness emerges from that and blossoms into joy. The heart opens to that joy and then the flow of Divine Love emerges until there is the overflow into bliss. So we have to sit long enough to allow the full experience, full realization and stabilize in it, and not have even the trace of an \u201cI-thought\u201d thinking this is happening to me, but complete silence, so that you are it. If there is still an \u201cI-thought\u201d that is containing it, or judging it, or evaluating it, it will hold down the experience to a shallow level. So there has to be a complete surrender and melting into it, and then there indeed is a charge, very powerful. (Event: Divine Love is Real Retreat)",

The other three are: simplicity, leading a simple life without excess, without ostentation, without wastage. . . . truthfulness, a yogi is dedicated to being truthful\u2014and more than just truthful in a factual sense, but leading an authentic life. . . . the third one is seva, or service, to lead a life that\u2019s not based on getting as much as you can for yourself, but of giving as much as you can to the world. . . . Now, a Satsang, for those of you who haven\u2019t been to one, the word \u201cSat\u201d you\u2019ll notice appears a lot in our discourse here, Sat refers to the Supreme Beingness, the truth of what we are when we take away all of the falseness and the mediated and artificial aspects of our self, when we get down to what is natural and eternal in ourselves. And yoga means \u201cyoke,\u201d union. . . . You know we tend to think that that it\u2019s only people out there who sabotage our happiness, but it\u2019s actually we who are responsible for that; we set that up. And once we assume our own responsibility for our happiness, then life begins to get a lot better. . . . And gradually our intellect, our buddhi, becomes clearer and clearer, and we begin to realize the ways that we\u2019d been sabotaging ourselves on subtler and subtler levels until we get to the root of the phantasies that have been motivating us to deny ourselves or to cheat ourselves of our own bliss . . .\u201d",

This trinity is an archetype and exists in every religion, every spiritual path, although it has different names in different paths. . . . In the yogic path, it\u2019s only one of a number of trinities, however; we could call it the \u201cvertical trinity.\u201d And the equivalent in the yogic tradition is noted by the words \u201cSat, Chit, and Ananda.\u201d\u00a0 . . . But there is also a horizontal trinity that is often noted by the names of three gods:\u201d Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankara.\u201d . . . They refer to creation, sustenance, and destruction, if you will\u2014or transformation. But you can think of it as kind of a black board, or a white board, which is the Absolute; we could say that\u2019s Shiva. And then on that someone writes with a pen a sentence that is a narrative, an ego narrative: the story of a civilization, the story of a culture\u2014or the story of your own life. And then once that\u2019s written, Vishnu repeats it over and over again; it becomes a pattern that gets sustained in one\u2019s life. Not only sustained, but if the pattern is pathological, then stained: one\u2019s life becomes stained by a pattern that repeats automatically, over and over again. How many of you have had the experience of making the same mistake over and over again in your life?\u201d",

And it\u2019s because the human being in the state of ego-consciousness is a monkey: its monkey mind is always chattering, its interests are mainly in food and sex, and it is wild and will not come under discipline. So the monkey is a wonderful metaphor. And yet this monkey, Hanuman, becomes divine. . . . It is said that God stands for G.O.D.: Generation, Operation, Destruction. . . .

And thinking alone wont get you out of the box of the ego; the two must be integrated.\u201d Likewise, there are also two manifestations of love in action. Karma yoga is the essence of love in action, \u201cto act without greed, possessiveness, the desire for some ulterior agenda to be fulfilled by the ego, then that will be able to unravel the egos knots and unwillingness to love. The second one is community because its not just a matter of \u2018What do I do,\u2019 but the real test is can I help form a communion of love with other human beings?cause that\u2019s the ultimate test isn\u2019t it?
