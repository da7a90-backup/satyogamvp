Now we need a wisdom school to help us create a new culture in the ruins of the world that is now dying.</p><p>“Sat” means the highest level of being, and “yoga” means union. Thus, Sat Yoga means attaining union with the highest level of your being, or consciousness, and this will be the aim in this course.</p><p>In my own life, I always longed for such a school. My clearest thought from the moment I became a young adult was: “Where are the wise tribal leaders who will guide me how to live a life?” And destiny arranged it that I would meet Shunyamurti quite early in my life, in my twenties, who would embody just what I was looking for, in a way I could have never imagined; a man of uninhibited creative imagination, wide-ranging philosophic knowledge, psychological sensitivity and skill, and devoted to using his intelligence to deepen his understanding of reality for the betterment of our world.</p><p>Shunyamurti recognized the need for the creation of a Wisdom School back in 2001. On 9/11, the day of the infamous demolition of the World Trade Center buildings in New York, he foresaw the rapid acceleration of the demise of the current form of human civilization, and wanted to create an institution that could prepare people for what was coming, which included helping people develop the skills necessary to create a higher culture in its place.</p><p>He had already spent many years preparing himself to lead such a school, he had earned a BA in philosophy, doctorates in law and psychology, and studied and practiced psychoanalysis, as well as hypnotherapy, and other modalities of healing. And he also spent years training in meditation in India. At a crucial juncture in his life, he left the practice of law and joined an ashram in India, where he entered blissful states, and was surprised that others were not able to access the vibrational frequency that took him to God-consciousness.</p><p>Life in an ashram is dedicated to meditation, but something was holding people in a pattern of suffering, and he was called upon to be a kind of therapist, which then led him to continue to develop his journey as a healer back in the West, first to study and practice, as I said, hypnotherapy, but also past life regression, Jungian analysis and dreamwork, and then other types of psychoanalysis, including classical Freudian analysis and later developments of psychoanalysis, including Kleinian, Bionian, and object-relations theory, and finally Lacanian theory, which is the most abstract of all the theories. And then he studied postmodern philosophy and the Western philosophical tradition in detail.</p><p>He gradually came to the realization that none of these theories of the mind were accurate enough or complete enough, to understand the entire psyche, including human potential, to have the power to untie the knots of suffering that bring people to therapy, because there was incomplete understanding of consciousness, as he came to see, within the therapeutic modalities that he had been studying, and also because the materialist paradigm dominant in the modern age has discarded and rejected the idea that there are higher levels of consciousness beyond the ego. Therefore, none of these forms of psychotherapy can take you beyond the ego.</p><p>And from his time in India, he saw that the spiritual traditions didn’t have the answers either because they were formed thousands of years ago, before the modern ego structure emerged. In essence, he discovered that neither reason nor spiritual practice were sufficient for God-realization. Since the paradigms that he encountered were inaccurate and incomplete, he felt he had to create one that actually worked, and miraculously he did so.</p><p>Shunyamurti states very clearly, “Our society now produces very few wise leaders, benefactors, artists, or sages capable of guiding the world out of its current dire situation. A wisdom school enables the transmission of personal empowerment, divine love, cultural genius, spiritual energy, compassionate understanding, and the other building blocks necessary for creating and sustaining a higher form of human culture.”</p><p>Our wisdom school, the Sat Yoga Institute, constitutes the heart of the Sat Yoga Ashram community. Both are founded and led by Shunyamurti, who is also our research director and our teacher, and he has distilled incredible teachings for us, based on the world’s entire spiritual heritage, including the teachings of all the great religions, and <em>dharmas</em>, philosophers, esoteric practices like alchemy, psychological and psychoanalytic theories and methods, as well as the findings of such fields as quantum physics, and the other hard sciences—mathematics, anthropology, sociology, literature, poetry, music, and all the other arts, all developed by humanity over the centuries. He now encourages all of us to become visionary thinkers and creators.</p><p>Wisdom schools have been at the core of every culture from time immemorial, and culture is the fermentation of the possibilities of growth in our intelligence. Every culture is founded by a wise man, or wise human being. A wise human being will usually gather a circle of people around him or her, who want wisdom, a self-chosen elite that seek transcendence. And as the circle expands, you have a growing culture, based on a new understanding of the world, with a new vision, and around that a successful society can grow. Such societies tend to thrive, but eventually the wise die off, and the culture becomes run by egos who don’t want wisdom, and the culture eventually dies.</p><p>So unless you keep alive wisdom schools, your society will not be sustainable. A society without a vision, an accurate understanding of reality, that includes a higher purpose to life, in accord with the greatness of our superconscious potential, will not long survive. Only those with wisdom can download new visions and pathways to human flourishing, and protect the natural resources of our planetary environment on which we depend.</p><p>So, culture consists of culturing—the fermentation that leads to this alchemical transformation of consciousness, to produce leaders with the wisdom and understanding and ability to heal, interpret dreams, solve problems, prevent wars, and keep one’s tribe or culture safe, and in a state of integrity, relating to other cultures at the highest level, as well as turning ordinary people into extraordinary leaders able to see the blessings hidden in the most catastrophic situations, and able to solve impossible problems, successfully riding every wave of change that comes. These are the necessary capacities for the development of society, and throughout time they have come out of the wisdom schools.</p><p>Today, very few authentic wisdom schools exist, and do not function for society at large, as they did in ancient and classical times. So two types of schools developed concurrently in the ancient world; one was the <em>mystery school</em>, and it was called that because its initiates were sworn to secrecy—no one outside of the school was ever to know what were the teachings or the processes offered there, and, in fact, the secrets were extremely well kept. Even today, scholars have no certain knowledge of what was taught in many of the mystery schools. There are many theories, but no definite knowledge.</p><p><em>Wisdom schools</em>, on the other hand, like Plato’s Academy, were open, and their teachings were recorded in books that became publicly available. Often initiates attended both a mystery school and a wisdom school, integrating what was learned in both. The wisdom schools we know began with the school of Pythagoras, along with the Orphic mystery school. Later, the Platonic Academy and the Eleusinian mystery school, functioned as paired institutions, and had transformative effects on several generations of human beings, sustaining the culture of that period.</p><p>Before the founding of the Greek city states, ancient Egypt already, for many centuries, had famous mystery schools. Such circles were thriving as well in ancient China, and the most famous wisdom schools were led by Daoist sages such as Laozi and Zhuangzi. Their writings still provide inspiration and transcendent insights to careful readers. In the ancient Middle East, there were other schools that combined aspects of the mystery school approach, together with some open teachings, in order to attract new students to want to get the deeper level of teachings which were secret, or esoteric. These later became the basis for the growth of religions, such as the school of the Magi in Persia, the Essenes in ancient Israel, the school of John the Baptist, and of course, the school led by Yeshua that later developed into Christianity.</p><p>And of course, we are all aware of the great wisdom schools of India, that grew into Jainism, Buddhism, and the many Vedic schools. In the Middle Ages, after the delivery of the Quran through the Prophet Muhammad, the message of the Prophet led to the development of profound Sufi wisdom schools in Spain, North Africa, Syria, Iraq, India, and China. Iran became famous for its Shiite wisdom schools. The two most famous sages to emerge from the Muslim mystical lineages were the Sheikh Al Akbar Ibn Arabi, and the divinely drunken poet Jalaluddin Rumi. The Medieval European universities also began as wisdom schools. Schools of alchemy thrived in those times, but as a new kind of mystery school in which the teachings were coded and treated as chemical processes, rather than as psychospiritual teachings that they were. Thus, they avoided being attacked as heretical by the church, and benefited by being sponsored by wealthy patrons who hoped the alchemists could really turn lead into gold. The Medieval period also spawned schools of magic and those that taught ecstatic practices for attaining higher states of consciousness, and these included the schools of Kabbalah and those that transmitted Gnostic and Hermetic teachings.</p><p>But the oldest of all the schools were the ancient schools of yoga that sprouted throughout ancient India. They left a profound wealth of resources in the form of texts and methods of spiritual transformation, and their lineages continue today. The most famous yogic texts range from the <em>Upanishads</em> to Patanjali’s <em>Yoga Sutras</em>, to the works of the Shaivite wisdom schools of Kashmir, the Vira Shiva school in Karnataka, and the later Sutras of Tantric Yoga, all of which are still widely studied today. In fact, every region of India has its wisdom schools, and they had profound effects on the development of culture, including on sculpture, painting, music, drama, dance, and on the general values and attitudes towards life.</p><p>The classical world’s wisdom schools were also referred to as mystery schools because their purpose is to reveal the ultimate mysteries of reality. They studied the mystery of consciousness, the mystery of death, the mystery of destiny, and the mystery of creation. The primary focus, though, was on mastering the mysterious function of our ordinary ego-consciousness. They also develop maps of levels of consciousness, and theories about why people often resist inner growth and positive change. To overcome such mysterious resistances, in the Sat Yoga Wisdom School, we study and practice ways to increase our willpower, to eliminate unwanted and destructive habits, and augment our ability to learn from experience, and to transcend the ego itself.</p><p>The wisdom school focuses on the mystery of intelligence, and offers methods to increase our intelligence, and develop many different forms of intelligence, for dealing with various aspects of our existence. The wisdom school teaches us what potentialities we have, what supernormal powers we may be able to develop, and it also teaches us how to activate the highest levels of consciousness, to gain peace of mind, and to access divine love, and access our courage, our joy, and ultimately eternal life through union with the Source of our being, or God.</p><p>The teachings of our wisdom school are more relevant than ever, as we will need to access our higher consciousness, to be able to survive and thrive, as individuals and as a species in the face of the challenges our world is now facing. It will take great wisdom on the part of many people to overcome the pandemic, to avoid wars, to sustain the social order, and to cope with climate change and other existential threats. Our wisdom school offers the great benefit of having a living teacher. There is a constant downpour of new teachings, insights, applications of new paradigms to our ever-changing circumstances. The old wine of the perennial philosophy is being poured into new bottles, but also new wine of wisdom is being fermented that has never been offered before. Our wisdom school is designed to be of immediate relevance to our students. We want to help everyone to increase your ability to cope creatively and successfully with the challenges of our unique historic moment. We need to develop wise leaders, and a healthier culture, and produce brilliant new ideas that can be cultivated and refined into new ways of life, adaptive to our new conditions, and easily transmitted to others, and this course is one product of the efforts of the members of the Sat Yoga Wisdom School.</p><p>Paradoxically, it is only in our own time, when wisdom is needed more than ever, that there is a lack of such higher educational centers. The mainstream universities no longer serve the function of transmitting wisdom. Neither do the religious institutions, for the most part. It is important to distinguish a true wisdom school from a cult, which is centered on the worship of a particular personality, scripture, or dogma. The approach of our wisdom school is to teach you how to think for yourself, how to read the subtle messages that reality presents, and how to navigate through life without creating negative karma. The final goal is to attain Self-realization.</p><p>But if we go through life the way most people do, without developing our intelligence, without discovering the higher wisdom, without solving the mystery of who and what we are beyond our apparent form, then we doom ourselves to lives of social or psychological inadequacy, of being manipulated by the media, of giving into blind impulse, and generally suffering from failure of critical thinking, volatile emotionality, and without the capacity to sustain healthy love relationships. Consequently, most people lead unhappy lives. At this point, it may even doom us to extinction as a species.</p><p>There is a great difference between a wisdom school and an ordinary university, that is important to our understanding of what wisdom schools can offer. And to understand this, we must recognize that there are seven different kinds of knowledge.</p><p>The first is <em>common knowledge</em>—the kind of knowledge you need to deal with the ordinary tasks of life. And this includes, in our modern urban society, the knowledge of how to drive, how to deal with money, basic etiquette and appropriate behavior in different settings, how to read, write, do basic mathematics, send emails, and surf the internet. This is the kind of knowledge that starts at a very young age, with toilet training, and learning how to adapt to other children in a playground, how to behave in school, and in general, how to discipline yourself to submit to the dictates of the clock. This is the knowledge you must have gained by the time you leave high school. In other cultures in earlier periods, common knowledge would have included how to not get lost in the forest, or the desert, how to find water, knowing what is safe to eat, and the general tribal customs.</p><p>The second form of knowledge is <em>specialized knowledge</em>, and this is what is formally taught in technical and trade schools, or what most students learn in a university. Although universities used to be focused on general education in the appreciation of literature and the arts, critical thinking, knowledge of the sciences, higher mathematics, history, and philosophy, in recent times they became more oriented toward career preparation. Students nowadays tend to focus either on a pre-med program, or preparation for law school, or business and economics, or a career using some application of psychology, say, in media studies.</p><p>Of course, some young adults would enlist in the military, or in a religious seminary, or just join the family business. In the past, an apprenticeship would be offered in some special skill, and one might join a guild. And in traditional societies, for example, women have their own specialized training concerning pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, cooking, sewing, and child raising, among other skills.</p><p>The third kind of knowledge is what we call <em>forbidden knowledge</em>. This may include the questions you are not allowed to ask, the places you are not allowed to go, the people you must not hang out with, the websites you must not visit, as well as understanding the repressed memories and fantasies in the subconscious mind.</p><p>This is all the information that may be censored by the family system and the social system. Many people vaguely know that there are skeletons in the family closet—events, and people not to be talked about. We not only have internalized commands not to know, but commands not to know that we must not know. Such forbidden knowledge may have severe effects on the psychological development and functioning of the ego. In many cases, it may require the help of a trained psychoanalyst to uncover such secrets and to recover from their effects.</p><p>Fourth is <em>unbearable knowledge</em>. This is the knowledge that we could know if we wanted to, but of which we prefer to stay in denial and forgetfulness, because it simply feels too bad to think about. Some unbearable knowledge is deeply repressed, and surrounded by a more general amnesia regarding other matters that might trigger a memory of such painful remembrance. So elaborate defense mechanisms may be built around such traumatic wounds. Any memory that would be overwhelming to our sense of equilibrium will be filtered out, so we can function in the world, but we often pay a big price in terms of stunted intellectual curiosity or ability to connect with other people. And this happens on a social level as well—there’s information that is censored from the history books, and there is relevant information that is not reported in the news or mentioned by the parents or teachers. And this is the information that the agents of the system responsible for managing information flow decide is dangerous to the goals and functioning of the political and economic system. Of course, this happens on all levels. There is unbearable knowledge that couples do not share, there is knowledge repressed by family systems and, of course, by each ego system.</p><p>The society uses the arts to vent some of the energies that unbearable knowledge can cause to otherwise explode. And this is the reason for the production of novels, movies, and plays that depict such traumatic knowledge in a vicarious way, so that the destructive impulses can be projected temporarily. And sports have the same value. Since unbearable knowledge can cause a meltdown, the field of psychotherapy had developed, along with psychiatric drugs, to help in dealing with this immense social problem. A wisdom school offers another way of encountering forbidden and unbearable knowledge, and using that information to grow to higher levels of consciousness.</p><p>Fifth is <em>metaphysical knowledge</em>—understanding that orients one to the greater context of reality, to the meaning of life, to values that will sustain growth and attainment of the highest potentialities of consciousness. Metaphysical knowledge is symbolic in nature—it consists of concepts that enable paradigm shifts and life transitions. This is the kind of knowledge that helps one confront the difficult passages, such as the death of a loved one, or a divorce or some other shock, that suddenly shatters the ego’s sense of reality, and creates a feeling of lostness and dread. Metaphysical knowledge performs the function of a higher superstructure that offers a path in life toward individuation and Self-realization. Joseph Campbell famously referred to this knowledge as “The hero’s journey.” It helps us when we find ourselves in a dark night of the soul, or during and after a psychological breakdown. It is this kind of knowledge that can help us feel hope again, and take steps toward rebuilding our lives. It is in such states that we come to appreciate more deeply such as aspects of reality as beauty, and nature, goodness, mercy, wisdom, compassion, and love—aspects of reality that are usually taken for granted and denigrated.</p><p>The sixth kind of knowledge we call <em>shamanic knowledge</em>. In traditional cultures, this was the domain of the witch, the wise elders, the medicine man, or the shaman. There is a wide range of shamanic knowledge, beginning with such capacities as knowing how to find and process medicinal herbs. This includes, also, other substances that alter consciousness, and the shaman must know how to guide others on such inner journeys. The shaman must understand the meaning of dreams and synchronicities. The shaman must be able to deal with paranormal phenomena, including ghosts, evil spirits, and people who are possessed by such. The shaman must know how to remove curses, to fight off dark forces, and to transmit spiritual power to those who are weak and under the influence of negative entities and ideas. Of course, to do this, the shaman must also be on good terms with the Great Spirit, and with various forms of the deity or divine power that can assist in healing and encouraging, conferring visions, and offering a flow of energy for use in ritual action.</p><p>The shaman must be able to invoke the help of angels and other positive celestial forces, as well as elementals and other nature spirits. And all this can be understood in a more rational and scientific context without losing the core of truth that this folk wisdom contains. Today, such knowledge is more often embodied in the form of hypnotherapy, visualization, past life regression, trance dancing, chanting, psychodrama, and other such practices, as well as ritual gatherings that include the taking of entheogens. For many in the West today, because of cynicism, scientism, and allegiance to the medical establishment, or loyalty to conventional religious institutions, there is very little access to shamanic knowledge, and few truly well-trained shamans. Some people who call themselves that, lead gatherings, in which powerful substances that alter consciousness are used, but because they are not usually trained in understanding the structure of the ego, they can find themselves in situations that are out of control. Many people who engage in such practices are traumatized by bad trips, and some even have psychotic breakdowns. The territory of altering consciousness with chemicals should be entered with extreme caution, with sensitivity to set and setting, and with adept help and guidance, should it be needed. But it also should be understood that such chemicals are not needed to access shamanic knowledge. Meditation training is a safer and more useful path.</p><p>Finally, the seventh form of knowledge is <em>supreme knowledge</em>, the direct realization of God-consciousness. Of course, in different cultures and traditions, this may be referred to as Nirvana or Buddha-Nature, <em>Brahman</em>, the Dao, Absolute Consciousness, or the One Self. Attainment of this level of being, which brings liberation from all kinds of suffering, and graduation from the school of life or the wheel of death and rebirth, is the core of the curriculum of a wisdom school, and for this, too, meditation is the primary path. The seventh kind of knowledge that we call supreme knowledge involves the revelation of our total potentiality. It is the knowledge of the presence of God within and without, the actual feeling of infinite divine love in the heart, as well as direct understanding of Ultimate Reality.</p><p>It involves the complete cleansing of our perception, to see with unitive vision the oneness or nonduality of all that is, that we constitute a single, awesome, infinite, eternal Being. The knowledge may include precognition of the future, and of the distant past, and the revelation of higher dimensions of the structure and destiny of the world, and of the Will of God. This knowledge opens the doorway to the realm of the miraculous.</p><p>Shunyamurti clarifies that a wisdom school devoted to the attainment by students of these higher levels of knowledge, will only attract those with the courage to leave the herd mentality, willing to think outside the box, to push the envelope, to leap into the unknown, to become different in every moment, to face every new event fearlessly, always remaining centered in the Real Self, in all ways surrendered to God, and fully Self-possessed. This knowledge enables us to respond to life with wisdom and compassion, to remain calm, poised, conscious masters of every situation.</p><p>A wisdom school teaches us also how to be open to new ideas, to think without prejudice, to use our minds dialectically, and creatively, and to reach levels of divine consciousness that are beyond symbolic thought. Essentially, a wisdom school teaches us how to apperceive and deploy our consciousness in a new way, to focus our attention, our willpower, and our capacity to love and create for the highest purposes.</p><p>This course is an introduction to those more advanced levels of Sat Yoga training that will include such topics as how to be centered in the heart, to connect to the Source of our being, and to live a divine life. But we will also learn a great deal of shamanic knowledge, including how to sense the energy-field, to augment our intuition, to read people’s body language, and to know how to interpret dreams and symptoms of suffering, and, more importantly, to have the skills to free others from their bondage to lower levels of consciousness and self-defeating attitudes.</p><p>So in this first course, you will learn how to understand your ego structure, the logic that underlies any symptoms of physical and mental suffering, methods of deconstructing, transforming, and transcending the ego, and a rational, scientific way of understanding consciousness that is also congruent with what is taught by all religions at their deepest level. You will learn that your current ego structure is not who you are—it is just a temporary operating system that can be upgraded. You will learn that your potential powers of consciousness can be used to become a positive catalyst for changing the world in beautiful ways.</p><p>Today, most adults are the products of a dumbed-down educational system, an exhausted and degraded culture, an alienating social system, and people are taught not to be curious, or to want to grow to higher levels. Most people no longer read serious books, but they get their information from the ingeniously censored internet. Most people do not learn how to think critically and creatively, nor to develop their feeling function or intuition to their fullest extent. Most people are clueless as to what is really happening in the world. Most people do not understand themselves or other people, and most are ruled by fear, and sensuous desire. And many feel too weak even to want to know, to grow, or even hear the kind of information we are presenting. A wisdom school is not for everyone, but if you yearn to discover who you are and what you are capable of, this resource will be invaluable.</p><p>If we are going to meet the challenges of our historic moment of social and cultural collapse, we must develop the power of profound understanding, creative intelligence, tremendous willpower, nobility of spirit, and unconditional love. We must realize our true nature as eternal, deathless Spirit. In other words, we must learn to live in both the horizontal plane and the vertical dimension of our being, in an integrated manner. And to show this graphically, we employ the ancient symbol from spiritual science, of the cross, a symbol that has many meanings and appears in our classes often. And this will show different aspects of the spiritual path.</p><p>The archetype of the cross is used here to differentiate our inner world from our outer world. Here, time is represented by the horizontal axis, while ascension to our higher levels of being is represented by the vertical axis. The moment one joins a wisdom school or enters into inner work, one shifts one’s focus and begins to perceive the horizontal plane from the higher levels of the vertical. And this shift is the key to what is called the opening of the third eye, the eye of wisdom, and enables us to achieve transformation of our lives, our values, and our state of being.</p><p>This course, and those which will follow, will guide you from elementary to advanced levels of wisdom, and we hope that this has been a helpful beginning, offering you a historical context and a sense of the kind of knowledge and power that shall be transmitted. We will go further into the curriculum of the Sat Yoga Wisdom School in our next class, but please let us know if you have any questions about the information in this presentation, and we hope that you will also be participating in the offline writing assignments, and other aspects of this course.</p><p>Until next time, thank you.</p><p>Namaste.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDownloads\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Concept-of-the-Wisdom-and-Mystery-School.pdf">The Concept of the Wisdom and Mystery School.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/sdcv9v/Class_1_Final_Final-converted7l7ia.mp3">The Concept of the Wisdom and Mystery School – Audio MP3</a></p>\n\t\t<p>Enter the Great Mystery and pierce the veil of illusion!

Only a pure culture of integrated wisdom, love, and power, tended by living teachers, will produce leaders with the ability to guide, govern, heal the sick, resolve social antagonisms, prevent wars, and sustain the integrity of law and customs to ensure the highest quality of life for all beings. Our wisdom school is brewing a new culture to replace our dying civilization, one that will inspire extraordinary leaders with access to the infinite intelligence that is the source of our Being, enabling the human spirit to triumph over every adversity and redream the world.</p><p>"Our society now produces very few wise leaders, benefactors, artists, or sages capable of guiding the world out of its current dire situation. A wisdom school enables the transmission of personal empowerment, divine love, cultural genius, spiritual energy, compassionate understanding, and the other building blocks necessary for creating and sustaining a higher form of human culture."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Wisdom School & The Mystery School</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Two types of schools developed concurrently in the ancient world: the wisdom school and the mystery school. They had two different functions, operating in different modes of consciousness—the symbolic and the experiential—but were symbiotic and congruent.</p><p>The Wisdom School</p><p>A <strong>wisdom school</strong> focuses on the full spectrum of intelligence and offers methods to increase our cognitive capacities, emotional understanding, and the many other forms of intelligence needed for coping with the enigmas of existence and fulfilling our potential. The wisdom school teaches us how to develop the supernormal powers that we have been designed by the Creator to master.</p><p>The wisdom schools were open to all qualified students, and their teachings were recorded in books that became publicly available. Some ancient wisdom schools include:</p><ul><li>The Pythagorean School</li><li>Plato’s Academy</li><li>The Yoga Schools of ancient India (they predate the Greek schools and functioned as wisdom and mystery school combined—as does ours)</li><li>The Daoist Schools of China</li></ul><p>The Mystery School</p><p>A <strong>mystery school</strong> kept its teachings secret. In fact, the initiates were sworn to keep them confidential. No outsider was ever to know the curriculum or the processes offered there. The secrets were so well kept, that even today, scholars have no certain knowledge of what was taught in the classical mystery schools. Nonetheless, despite their eventual destruction, the esoteric knowledge has been transmitted and continues to be shared by illumined teachers with advanced disciples.</p><p>The secrecy was necessary to prevent persecution by state institutions that might judge them heretical. They also wanted to prevent immature minds from misinterpreting the subtle information. Finally, the secrecy was essential because some rites of passage involved forbidden shamanic ways of entering into altered states of consciousness.</p><p>Some of the famous Mystery Schools include:</p><ul><li>The Egyptian Mystery Schools</li><li>The Zoroastrian Schools of the Magi</li><li>The Orphic Mystery School</li><li>The Eleusinian Mystery School</li><li>The original Christian Mystery School</li></ul><p>Of course, the wisdom schools also dealt with the great mysteries of reality, including the nature of Being, consciousness, death, the enigma of free will, divination, and destiny—and most importantly, the secret path to self-transformation.<br /><br />Originally, seekers often attended both a mystery school and a wisdom school. The Sat Yoga Wisdom School integrates elements of both types of institution—because the nature of Self-realization is such that a secret transmission is required.</p><p>"A wisdom school, devoted to the attainment by students of these higher levels of knowledge, will only attract those with the courage to leave the herd mentality, willing to think outside the box, to push the envelope, to leap into the unknown, to become different in every moment, to face every new event fearlessly, always remaining centered in the Real Self, in all ways surrendered to God, fully Self-possessed. This knowledge enables us to respond to life with wisdom and compassion, to remain calm, poised, conscious masters of every situation."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The 7 Realms of Knowledge</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Common:</p><p>The kind of knowledge you need to deal with ordinary tasks in life.</p><p>Specialized:</p><p>Skills that are taught in technical and trade schools or universities.</p><p>Forbidden:</p><p>This may include the questions you are not allowed to ask, the places you are not allowed to go, the people you must not hang out with, the websites you must not visit, as well as the repressed memories and fantasies in the subconscious mind.</p><p>Unbearable:</p><p>What we could know if we wanted to, but of which we prefer to stay in denial, because it simply feels too bad to think about.</p><p>Metaphysical:</p><p>Understanding that orients one to the ultimate nature of reality, the value and meaning of life and death, the levels of Being that lie beyond the ego, and the laws that govern the unfoldment of our personal journey, as well as the destiny of the world.</p><p>Shamanic:</p><p>The expertise to work with herbs, interpret dreams, understand omens and means of divination, and enter the higher imaginal realms and astral planes of subtle perception in order to heal the sick, foresee the future, cast spells for good fortune, and telepathically connect.

Today, in the West, what is left of such knowledge is more often offered in the form of hypnotherapy, visualization, past life regression, exorcism, trance dancing, chanting, psychodrama, and other such therapeutic and ritual practices, as well as ceremonial gatherings that include the ingestion of entheogens.</p><p>Supreme:</p><p>The direct realization of the Absolute.

Our wisdom school is a new approach to spiritual development and liberation because we offer the knowledge in the form of a logical architecture that accords with current science and psychology, as well as the perennial philosophy. We are continuing the tradition of European universities, going back to the Middle Ages, as these were among the successors of the wisdom schools of the ancient world, and the educational process was divided into two levels, a Trivium and a Quadrivium, and I&#8217;m going to put those on the board for you.</p>\n<p>The Trivium was the introductory level, and it was the triple path, <em>tri vias.</em> The Quadrivium was the quadruple path, and it contained four subjects of study, which was the advanced level, and combined they covered seven disciplines, which was not an accidental choice, and we will be investigating the significance of that number and others in later classes on sacred mathematics.</p>\n<p>So the classical university curriculum was referred to as the <em>Seven Liberal Arts</em>. The classical Trivium consisted of the three subjects involved in the mastery of language: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. First, one studied the structure of language, which included nouns, adjectives, verbs, elements of correct sentences, and their different types, such as declarative, interrogative, as well as propositions about reality. And then one moved onto logic, which was about learning how to develop arguments, and to recognize which kinds of assertions and propositions are valid and relevant, and to understand the limitations of both inductive and deductive reasoning. Finally, one was ready for the culminating course in the Trivium&mdash;rhetoric&mdash;and this subject consists in the skills involved in presenting persuasive speeches and writings. In ancient Athens, it would have been called sophistry.</p>\n<p>After passing the Trivium tests, one could enter the Quadrivium, which was the advanced level, comprised of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. And arithmetic was considered to be the science of number in itself; geometry was number in space; music was considered number in time; and astronomy was number in the cosmos, or the &ldquo;music of the spheres&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>A well-rounded graduate of such a university was thus someone competent in verbal and mathematical skills, with a taste for music, and a reverence for the sublime beauty of God&#8217;s perfectly designed universe. Those universities, though, left out something important. They taught human logic, but they did not teach how to download revelations of profound insights from the Mind of God, which has been the main focus of the earlier wisdom schools. Nor did the new universities teach how to interpret sacred and mythological texts, at deep levels of psychospiritual subtlety, nor how to interpret dreams, visions, symptoms, synchronicities. All of these had been part of the purpose of the original wisdom schools. The newer academies limited their jurisdiction to the logical mathematical modes of thought, jettisoning the modes of intuition, feeling, and the free flights of creative imagination that enable us to access our innate genius.</p>\n<p>In our wisdom school, we have altered the old curriculum into one designed to gain mastery of the seven arts of liberation. And we also have an initiatory level, a Trivium of three disciplines, and an advanced Quadrivium, for those who want to go even further into the secrets of our spiritual potentialities. But in this class, we will only focus on the Trivium, because only after you have become adept in those arts is one able to understand the more subtle subjects of the advanced level.</p>\n<p>In our Trivium, we not only learn to think accurately, critically, uninhibitedly, imaginatively, and in accord with a variety of logics, but more importantly, we learn how to attain levels of higher consciousness, beyond linguistic thought or the transmission through symbols. Shunyamurti teaches us that the universities performed a valuable function by teaching people to think rigorously, to shift from the imaginary register of thought to the symbolic register of thought. The imaginary register of thought is that level which involves superstition, wishful thinking, superficial sentimentality, cognitive errors of many kinds, uncritical acceptance of ideological manipulation, and other defects that constitute this lowest level of egoic consciousness. This imaginary register of mind pertains to the concrete thinking that children learn, and it is incapable of thinking with subtlety and nuance, and is the mode of thinking operative until one reaches the adult level of thinking, which involves abstract thinking.</p>\n<p>So basically, the universities taught one how to shift from this imaginary register of mental chatter to rigorous thinking that is symbolic and based on dialectical reason. We&#8217;re going to explore the imaginary and symbolic registers of thought in a future class. What we are teaching is quantum superposition&mdash;quantum thinking, in alignment with the most recent developments in quantum physics. We have quantum minds, but we haven&#8217;t used them before, only the Newtonian level of consciousness. But for now, it&#8217;s important to recognize that what the universities did not accomplish was to enable students to understand that there are levels of mind beyond symbolic thought.</p>\n<p>At its best, symbolic thought points to that beyond. For example, we use such symbols as God, Buddha-Nature, or the Absolute, but do we really know what is meant by those words? Only if we go beyond the symbols to what they signify, or if we realize God or Buddhahood directly, can we understand and master reality. And this is the goal of a wisdom school. In essence, we do not want to simply be able to read books on theology. We want to attain theosis, which is the divinization of our own minds. Thus, in our wisdom school, we develop the capacity for reason, or Logos, but not merely to persuade people that our symbols are the right ones, we learn to use thought as an instrument for the attainment of the Supreme Real that lies beyond thought.</p>\n<p>This is important because nearly all the creative geniuses who have ever communicated about their process have admitted that they downloaded the information, or their vision, from a higher source. Many great composers, painters, philosophers, novelists, poets, as well as scientists, have said that they received their insight in a dream, or in a reverie state, or in some other altered state of consciousness, or they were simply sitting with an empty mind and suddenly they found themselves taking dictation from an inner voice. In other words, the great ideas that have structured and inspired human culture have not been produced by mere logic or ordinary modes of thinking, and yet our social order today has rejected the development of this skill of downloading ideas from higher levels of intelligence than the human ego. In fact, our educational system denies that there are any levels of consciousness beyond verbal and rhetorical skills, and mathematical or strategical calculation.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;Any ideas that come from prophecy, vision, or mystical exaltation, let alone near-death experiences or out-of-body experiences, are considered mere fantasy, or even psychosis. Our society and educational system have chosen to reject divine inspiration as impossible, and this has impoverished our species. And at the same time, ironically, it has made people more superstitious than ever, and unable to discern the difference between a valid prophetic vision and a merely fabricated fantasy. It has led to a dumbed-down population.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So today, people no longer even learn how to think coherently, let alone creatively, poetically, and holistically, nor to articulate expressively, because we have fallen into a mindset that settles for concrete images, and immature sentiments, rather than true symbols and profound feelings.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti further says, &ldquo;We have traded real thinking for mere cleverness. Thus, we have lost our wisdom of mind as well as the wisdom of the heart. We have become people who can calculate but cannot love. And we have lost the courage to think in ways not approved of by the media, by the government, by the family, and by all those pseudo-authorities masquerading as the Big Other.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Big Other, being, again, any other whose approval that we want and who tells us how we should think and what it means to be normal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are living through the tragedy of the breaking of the human spirit. Once we were the luminous children of God, immaterial souls, immortal manifestations of divine archetypes, and we had the willpower and intelligence to lead noble lives as compassionate healers, leaders, and creators. But in the modern world we have been reduced to bodies without souls, egos without the ability to love, split internally from our own being, and fragmented into many dissociated nodes of desire and fear, judgment and guilt, hunger for recognition and adulation. Our human brokenness and fallenness has produced the comedy of errors that we call history, which now is leading us toward planetary self-destruction. Our survival will require a return to wisdom by a critical number of living individuals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Another problem we face is that our educational system branched out into a complicated array of separate disciplines, or fields of study, that are each generally uninformed about developments in the other disciplines. This prevents holistic understanding. Even though there have been efforts to reintroduce interdisciplinary programs, they leave many blind spots. There are many cases in which the findings of one discipline cast doubt on the theories developed in another, but this dissonance is often censored. The result is that many educated people know many things, but those things have not been integrated into a complete and coherent worldview that is capable of resolving apparent problems.</p>\n<p>In our wisdom school, Shunyamurti integrates the most advanced findings of science, including quantum physics, chaos theory, complexity theory, and the insights from contemporary philosophy, psychoanalysis, and new modalities of logic, into our paradigm of reality.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says that, &ldquo;We need a holistic education that enables us to understand the Real in its wholeness, and overcome our partiality, and that has been the cause of the demise of our society and our species. Our limited, closed viewpoints, obsolete, and incoherent paradigms, along with our generally stunted development of symbolic and spiritual intelligence, has brought us to the brink of extinction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In essence, Shunyamurti discovered that the classical Trivium of grammar, logic, and rhetoric, focused on thinking alone, and dropped the aim of realizing our being. The concept of being vanished from our understanding of life. Existence, in other words, was shorn of essence. This was the mantra of the existentialists. The philosopher Martin Heidegger did try to resurrect the idea of being, but he limited the concept to <em>Dasein</em>, the individual being in the world. But there was no longer any reference to the much greater concept of the Supreme Being from which the world is projected.</p>\n<p>Our Trivium, therefore, begins with the recognition that we are, but we do not know what we are. We start from our being&mdash;not our doing, or functioning, or fitting into the superficial position or role one has in the social order. We are focused on the inner consciousness&mdash;who you really are. And we need a new paradigm of reality that begins from our being, our true nature, that may be in the world but is not of it, rather than the false self we&#8217;re indoctrinated to create. The ego is the original mask, and our bodies are in the world, but is our awareness of the world, or in the world, or is the world in our awareness? This knot must be accurately untangled if we are to regain all our forgotten potentialities of consciousness. And the wisdom school of Sat Yoga helps you get to your deeper Self, and live from that authentic being.</p>\n<p>Thus, the first subject of our Trivium is called <em>translation</em>. This means we must translate all our observations of experience into a more cohesive and authentic frame of reference in which the place of consciousness is correctly included. We must recognize that we see the world through the lens of an ego that projects its past traumas on the present, and unconsciously repeats old patterns of thought and behavior, and because the ego is split and self-deceiving, has no true freedom of will.</p>\n<p>To quote Shunyamurti again, &ldquo;Once we accept the fact that the ego is a false self, we can begin the search for the Real, and we can come to recognize consciousness and intelligence as an attribute of the Real Self, omnipresent and determinative of our destinies. Such a paradigm shift is underway in many alternative philosophies, including the return of idealism, pantheism, panentheism, and panpsychism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We will be discussing all those varieties of theory that attempt to characterize the presence of consciousness distributed throughout reality, but to achieve a paradigm shift that is not just an opinion or a guess, the authentic attainment of our being, our Supreme Beingness, is essential.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the second subject of our Trivium is <em>transformation</em>, and this involves removing the internal psychological resistances to attaining your Real Being. And there are a few things you need to know.</p>\n<p>The first one is what resists this realization is our false self, or the ego. The ego struggles to stay in power to continue running your life. Attaining your Real Self would annihilate your ego, and thus there is a major battle required to gain victory over the regressive forces of the ego. So this course and transformation is designed to enable you to overcome the ego, and gain genuine inner freedom to discover who and what you are. Some people ask, &ldquo;Why not go directly from translation to transcendence of the ego? Why the necessity of transformation of the ego first, if we&#8217;re only going to leave it behind anyway?&rdquo; And the answer is that the untransformed ego will resist transcendence and cause the project of liberation to become interminable. So a process of purgation, purification, and maturation is necessary.</p>\n<p>Says Shunyamurti, &ldquo;The classical spiritual movements from the earliest yoga teachings in India to the Buddhist lineages, including the early mystical Christianity and the Essenes, and later the Kabbalists among the Jews, and the Sufi sects in the Islamic world, did function successfully at one time to enable seekers to transcend the ego, but they eventually lost their effectiveness because the ego structure morphed into a much more highly defended and complex mental entity. The methods of devotion, service, charity, aspiration, and prayer were once sufficient, but now the ego will not and cannot surrender to a higher power. A more incisive methodology is needed to overcome the ego&#8217;s homeostasis. For this reason, we have designed an approach to transformation that makes use of the relationship of the Atman, or Real Self, to the soul and the ego, as well as make use of the logic and the vibrational frequency of the Atman to outwit the ego&#8217;s modes of defense.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We call this clinical method <em>Atmanology</em>, and the nuances of this approach will be explained in a future class.</p>\n<p>Going back to our diagram here, the three levels that I&#8217;ve written on the board are an essential tool to begin the process of transformation, to understand that the ego is the level of consciousness that identifies with body&mdash;meaning, if you are in egoic consciousness, when you say &ldquo;I&rdquo;, that &ldquo;I&rdquo; usually refers to your bodily vehicle. The soul is the vehicle of intelligence. It knows that its physical body is a vehicle for the phenomenal plane, but it itself is this vehicle of higher consciousness. It receives dreams, and visions, and creative inspirations, and therefore takes part of infinite consciousness. It is also called the incarnational body, and this lifespan of the soul transcends, thus, any particular individual body, and in the same way recognizes that it cannot be any particular body, because it is already participating in infinite consciousness.</p>\n<p>And Spirit, or Atman, this ultimate level of our being is the part of you never born, never touched by trauma, not identified with the body, in a state of absolute perfection, and that is who you are. And we are here to teach you to reach that state in which you will have access to all the wisdom of the Mind of God through direct connection, and that is what yoga means.</p>\n<p>But before transformation into Spirit can be achieved, a will to Truth must develop. One must want the Truth of one&#8217;s being at all costs. One must be willing to feel all the unbearable emotions that have been repressed into the subconscious levels of the ego. One must also open all the closets full of skeletons, accept all the forbidden knowledge about one&#8217;s history, be willing to drop all illusions, and leave behind the comfort zone of the ego. This, in turn, requires the awakening of the <em>buddhi</em>, the organ of the soul responsible for discernment, of authenticity and coherence of life.</p>\n<p>Because growth is usually slow and painful, and filled with the need to process shameful memories, confessions of guilt, the anguish of lack and failure, the anxiety of rejection, abandonment, judgment, of fraudulence, much of this work must be done in confidential sessions on an individual basis. Often, there is a need for intensive and frequent sessions to cope with overwhelming emotions that can cause complete breakdown before breakthrough is attained.</p>\n<p>Once the work of transformation has been completed, one is ready for the final ascent. The third subject in our Trivium, <em>transcendence</em>. Transcendence of the ego into the infinite reaches of pure consciousness will bring full empowerment, understanding, joy, and unlimited divine love. This is the first fruit of wisdom. And the main instrument for attaining transcendence is, of course, meditation.</p>\n<p>Our approach to meditation is simple and natural. When you truly wonder who you are, and what the source of consciousness really is, then your meditation will be filled with joy, attention, and concentration on the goal will be sustainable, and one will enter into a state of silent presence, in which the true nature of consciousness is revealed. The ego illusion will fall away, and the transcendent yet also immanent Self will emerge as the meaning of <em>I Am</em>.</p>\n<p>In sum, the goal of the Trivium is to gain an open mind, to gain the ability to think critically and creatively, to shift our paradigm of reality to activate higher levels of attunement, because consciousness has channels that you can tune into, and we want to teach you how to attune to higher levels of information. But also, to go to the highest level of consciousness and realize the infinite creative intelligence, beyond the event horizon of the ego, to receive information that is inconceivable to you at the level of the ego.</p>\n<p>Our Trivium will also take you to the point where you can, in the Quadrivium, be able to download inspired ideas from our Supreme Self, to help create a more beautiful and joyous world, silence the mind and unite with the Absolute, enjoy and share the attainment of full transcendence, the realization of the light and the bliss of pure Being, and then use that power to redream a new world.</p>\n<p>To end for today, grammar is the way into the mastery of a new language. We learned this at the beginning of this class, but translation for us is the mastery of reality&mdash;not just of a language. The key is to have a different paradigm, a different frame of reference, in which you recognize that reality is something that can be mastered. It is made of mind stuff, and in that sense, reality is also a language, but it is the language of the waking dream. After the building blocks of grammar, logic teaches you how to make assemblages of entailed propositions, to build a geometry&mdash;a whole system of thought&mdash;and use it to create new world systems. And this is logic of worlds.</p>\n<p>Rhetoric is the manifestation, not just of a persuasive argument, but the literal realization of the truth expressed as a beautiful world, where truth and beauty are revealed as one.</p>\n<p>Namaste.</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Structure-of-the-Sat-Yoga-Wisdom-School.pdf">The Structure of the Sat Yoga Wisdom School.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/udrcwm/Class_2_Final_Final-converteda98bl.mp3">The Structure of the Sat Yoga Wisdom School &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>There is much to learn from the structure of classical education that the modern systems lack.

One must want the truth of one’s Being at all costs, and the bliss of divine love.</p><p>One must:</p><ul><li>open all the closets full of skeletons, and</li><li>accept all the forbidden knowledge about one’s history</li><li>be willing to drop all fantasies and delusions of grandeur, and</li><li>leave behind the known, the ego’s comfort zone</li></ul><p>Once the work of transformation has been accomplished, one is ready for the final ascent, the third subject in our Trivium: <strong>Transcendence</strong>.</p><ul><li>The main instrument for attaining Transcendence is meditation. Our approach to meditation is simple and natural. When you actively wonder who you are and what consciousness really is, then your practice will become fascinating and astonishing. There is so much richness in simple, silent presence, in which serenity is restored and the great mystery revealed. The ego illusion will fall away, and the transcendent yet also immanent Self will emerge as the meaning of “I am.”</li></ul><p>In sum, the <strong>goal of our Trivium</strong> is:</p><ul><li>To restore a fresh and open mind</li><li>To gain the ability to think critically and creatively</li><li>To leap into new paradigms of reality</li><li>To attune to higher frequencies of the noosphere</li><li>To sustain the mastery of mind and activate one’s full creative potency</li><li>To assimilate levels of Truth that are inconceivable to the ego</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Ego, Soul, and Atman</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Sat Yoga’s approach to transformation is full-spectrum dominance of all levels of consciousness, including the Absolute Self, or Atman. Our method makes use of the always-present reality of the Self, to uplift awareness beyond both ego and soul.</p><ul><li><strong>Ego</strong> is mind identified with its bodily vehicle. when you say “I” in ego-consciousness, you mean your animated body.</li><li>The <strong>soul</strong> knows that the body is only the gross vehicle for consciousness. The soul itself is a more subtle vehicle operating in higher strata of our consciousness. The soul outlives the body. Its lifespan extends potentially through the entire cycle of time. The soul can access the Atman, often referred to as the Holy Spirit, or Shekhinah. The soul is designed to receive archetypal and prophetic dreams, and when purified can download from Atman new insights, healing energies, and miraculous powers. The organ of the soul is responsible for discernment of the Real and the regulation of the ego’s behavior is the Buddhi. It can only function when it has been awakened through spiritual effort.</li><li><strong>Spirit</strong>, or <strong>Atman</strong>, is the unborn universal consciousness, our Real Self. The Self is eternal and changeless, never touched by trauma, nor identified with body. The Self is always in a state of Absolute perfection—and that is who you really are.</li></ul>	===LESSON_END===

The three loci that we will be discussing today are the conscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the superconscious. Each is both a locus and a <em>loka</em>, which is the Sanskrit term for a &ldquo;world&rdquo; or &ldquo;realm&rdquo;. Spiritual development is a journey from the lower realm, which Dante called the <em>Inferno</em> (but which we refer to as the shadow level of the ego) to the <em>Purgatorio</em> or soul realm (where the purification of the ego and soul can occur) to the <em>Paradiso</em> of the superconscious.</p>\n<p>We write the subconscious below the level of the conscious because it is suppressed and repressed from conscious awareness. We write the superconscious above the level of the conscious mind because it is beyond and superior to the level of the conscious mind. But we are actually pervaded by all the levels, all the time, and are simply not aware of it. The subconscious may appear as emotions, unaccompanied by thoughts, or body symptoms, or relational issues, or unwanted yet unbreakable habits. The superconscious can appear as dreams, although dreams interweave all three levels, and include visions, insights, creative energies, ecstatic/mystical states, synchronicities, and other manifestations of higher intelligence and compassion.</p>\n<p>Most people have no sense of what the subconscious mind is, nor what it means in themselves. Society has long lost the living awareness of the importance of dreams, or of the larger forces governing one&#8217;s life, that are out of our conscious control. And yet the conscious mind&mdash;which we used to call the least important because it has the least amount of information about this entire situation&mdash;thinks it is in control, but it is not.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti discovered after studying all the major schools of psychology that they deal primarily with the surface conscious level. He then went on to study various schools of psychoanalysis which deal with the subconscious, but generally leave out most of the superconscious. Today, unfortunately, most therapists are trained to attend only to the conscious mind, and this is like trying to stay in the shallows at the beach and understand the ocean. We need to dive into the ocean, but we also need the skills to do that safely and accurately.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a deep yearning to understand reality, and to find lasting peace and fulfillment. Everyone wants an easy path to freedom from anxiety, but any authentic path is not easy. This is called the &ldquo;hero&#8217;s journey&rdquo; with good reason. However, there is a direct path that can be short in time if you&#8217;re willing to be wholehearted, consistent, and honest with yourself&mdash;and that in itself often requires training, and that is the path that we offer. It requires facing your shadow and processing it. If we want the peace, joy, and empowerment that comes with Self-realization, we have to understand our own consciousness on all its levels. We must recognize that the ego-consciousness is split between the conscious and the subconscious levels, which have very different intentions, and that there is a gatekeeper between the two that determines how much information passes between them.</p>\n<p>And since the ego operates by deceiving itself, there are technical difficulties in trying to do this alone; a teacher is very helpful to point out blind spots. By using the information in these classes, you will be able to deconstruct your ego and gain mastery, if you are rigorous in your surveillance of your consciousness and perceptive in catching its tricks. We have to let go of false ideas that both limit our access to higher levels of consciousness and prevent us from changing the way our ego functions. We have the inherent power to become masters over our minds, but we must awaken to our true nature, and awaken its latent powers by activating the superconscious.</p>\n<p>In the modern age, mainstream thought fell into atheism, materialism, and nihilism, and even worse, into narcissism and rejection of psychological maturation. Most were indoctrinated by a secular education to deny the reality of the superconscious level of mind that had always been the primary goal of spiritual development, and in fact it was the whole intention of culture to bring us the taste of that level of our being. This is the content and purpose of great poetry, music, drama, even athletics. And this is why the religions valued their saints and sages, because they could testify directly to the reality of the superconscious mind. Whether referred to as God or Buddha-Nature or some other term, they could transmit their inspirations to the culture at large, which kept the social order in equilibrium and accuracy in relation to cosmic law.</p>\n<p>But the idea of the superconscious mind was thrown out as a mystical delusion in the modern period. The twentieth century opened with the writings of Sigmund Freud, who showed that we are actually ruled by our subconscious mind. Psychoanalysis offered a new paradigm of reality, demonstrating how the fantasies harboring in the lowest level of our being disturb our rationality and create many of the symptoms of our suffering. But the Freudian paradigm contained only two levels: the conscious and the subconscious. As we know, Carl Jung broke away from Freud and affirmed that there is also a superconscious level, and although he did not go as far as the Eastern sages, he reintroduced the superconscious into our frame of reference.</p>\n<p>It is important for us, then, to understand what the three loci of consciousness are, and why the conscious mind is not a sufficient platform from which to understand all of reality. The difficulty, when we talk about the superconscious and subconscious, is that we have to do it from the conscious mind, and use conscious mind symbols and language. This is part of the problem that has always created an obstacle to understanding. The language of the conscious mind is a socialized language, overdetermined by ideology and used to create a fa&ccedil;ade, that is a defense against true Self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>If we do seek Self-knowledge, if we attempt to transcend the ego, we&#8217;ve been taught to fear becoming too different from others, or even going mad. And this is why it is important to study the writings of the sages, the philosophers of the ancient world, the mystics and the saints of the Medieval period, and the yogis of the East, who can teach us how to access the superconscious locus if we are willing to make a sustained effort. They taught humanity that it is possible to transcend the ego-mind and reach the soul or even pure Spirit. There is nothing to fear but the ego&rsquo;s fear itself. If we properly prepare our minds, its inherent drive to reach its true vastness will enable you to overcome all obstacles.</p>\n<p>The purpose of meditation, as well as other spiritual technologies such as breathwork, service, charity, fasting, prayer, and contemplation, is to raise the consciousness to the highest level through creating an appropriate container that can receive the highest of energies, the blissful light and power of the Real Self. We want to reach this superconscious and remain there. We want to be filled with the powers and potencies of God-consciousness and use those powers to purify the subconscious of its negative influence upon our conscious mind, and thus enable us to live in real freedom, joy, love, and wisdom. And this is also the goal of these classes.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti uses the analogy of throwing a ball up into the air and keeping it aloft as our goal in meditation&mdash;to keep the mind flying in the superconscious&mdash;but the subconscious fears and fantasies act as a gravity that pulls the mind back down and can cause one to fall into the lower states of consciousness once the meditation ends. Thus, we need to understand these three loci in order to have mastery over the downward pull of the subconscious. For some, the difficulty in beginning such a practice is cynicism, or disbelief in the possibility of ego transcendence.</p>\n<p>The dominant paradigm is still scientistic physicalism, or the belief that consciousness is produced in and by the brain, that our intelligence and our feelings are just a byproduct of brain chemistry and neural activity. Of course, some of the foremost thinkers have asserted otherwise, but their theories have been largely marginalized. For example, William James, the great American psychologist, argued with powerful evidence that the brain is not the producer, but only the receiver and transmitter of consciousness. Most people have grown up ignorant of such alternative ways of conceptualizing consciousness, and the relation of mind to brain.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the evidence that consciousness preexists the brain and remains after death is overwhelming, and yet even in the Middle Ages, when there was still a very religious form of consciousness, the desire to attain higher levels of being was already in battle with the ego&#8217;s subconscious desire to fall further into the sensory dimension, from the ethereal levels of awareness. This is why the religions portrayed the world as a battlefield and our spiritual life as an arena of warfare; the idea that our better nature must struggle against the devil, and convinced us that we are vulnerable to the desire to be seduced by the devil, or to speak in psychological terms, to be overcome by addictive tendencies, infantile neediness, and other regressed states of emotional reactivity. This internal battle led to the emergence of what would now be called mental illnesses, but they were treated in the Middle Ages as demonic possession. The prescription was increased ascetic penances, including self-flagellation, fasting, and ceaseless prayer, and there were special rituals of reconsecration of one&#8217;s life to God. In worst case scenarios, exorcisms had to be done.</p>\n<p>In the modern period, the field of psychiatry arose based on the belief that madness was caused by the brain, which required retraining, chemical treatment, or even shock therapy or lobotomy. Psychiatry thus contributed even more to the denial of the spiritual dimension of our being and made us dependent upon drugs to maintain our equilibrium. And thus, we now have an epidemic of drug abuse. By the end of the twentieth century, because of such factors as the insights of parapsychology and use of entheogens in the growing counterculture, but even more importantly, from the findings of quantum physics, and the shift to understanding the importance of consciousness as the ground of reality, there has been a reopening of the question, &ldquo;What is consciousness?&rdquo; And yet the mainstream schools of consciousness studies still focus on neurophysiology, rather than attuning to our superconscious potentialities.</p>\n<p>Our goal in this course is to encourage you to experiment with meditation as the most direct way to reach the source of being, while facing consciously and directly the demons of the subconscious.</p>\n<p>These three loci of mind are general categories of consciousness. Each of the three has levels within them, nuances in specific areas and aspects that we are not going to cover in today&#8217;s class; we are going to give a simplified, introductory view of each locus, and in future classes we will explore the details and implications and the potentialities that each locus of consciousness can offer.</p>\n<p>The ego, which is a hybrid or compound of the conscious and subconscious levels of mind, and that includes an agency that censors the information that your conscious mind receives, is therefore not an adequate vehicle with which to navigate your life and to understand the full range of potentials that consciousness offers, because the ego is an operating system specifically designed to limit the amount of creative intelligence that you can access. We will go into this censoring agency in class four, which is completely dedicated to this topic.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;The ego is structured this way because it is an instrument of social adaptation, designed to direct a child to adapt to school and later to the social system, that usually requires one to get a job, or join an army, or get an advanced degree for reasons of prestige&mdash;actions that a more detached individual might otherwise think are foolish. The ego is designed to make you adapt to your family system, and then the larger social order. This usually means becoming a docile sheep who follows the herd mentality, and makes that way of living seem normal and sane, and other ways of living to seem mad. Wisdom requires you to have the courage to separate from the herd, to think for yourself, to individuate, to become a leader, not a follower. Of course, now, during times that are no longer normal, the laws and the system itself is crazy making so nearly everyone is in a state of cognitive dissonance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words, things don&#8217;t make sense. The implications of the ego as an instrument designed for social control are: your ego has no free will (although it believes it does), cannot control its emotions or thoughts, and cannot gain internal stability without the approval of the other.</p>\n<p>I will refer again, now, to the map that we drew in the previous class, which is the basic symbol of the cross. And the horizontal axis that refers to the phenomenal plane is now referring to the conscious mind. And the vertical axis, the north-south axis, will represent, as always, the vertical dimension. But now, we will add the superconscious level and the subconscious level, to show that as you go higher in the vertical dimension, the more freedom you have, and the more, of course, you are connecting to the superconscious level. And this gives you the power to de-potentiate the influences of the subconscious mind on your conscious mind.</p>\n<p>The more that you do this, you will be able to live in an intelligent and empowered way. And essentially, your conscious mind is increasing in intelligence as it reaches for the superconscious. And eventually, the goal is that your superconscious level of mind becomes your conscious level of mind.</p>\n<p>These three loci of consciousness show there are levels of the spectrum of mind below and above the threshold of waking consciousness, but it is all still a single intelligence that makes up yourself. The imposition of the ego starts from the mind becoming identified with the body. As an infant, you don&#8217;t start out with mind in full control of the body&mdash;it takes months for consciousness to gain the motor skills to operate the body. When you are born, you cannot stand up nor even turn over in your crib. The human being is totally helpless, and even though it has an animal body, it does not have preprogrammed instincts. Because the human is designed to be more than an animal, the body is therefore a vehicle or an instrument rather than an identity.</p>\n<p>And this is why the human consciousness and the animal body as its vehicle are not in sync, as it is with animals, and why we feel estranged from our own bodies and from nature. Once the ego is installed, we feel identified with the body, nonetheless, and then we are estranged from our real nature&mdash;the superconscious&mdash;that the ego cuts off and we forget about. The reason this happens is because the ego fills our mind with language and emotions that destroy our clarity, projecting our lack on the body and world and make us obsessed with trying to calm our stress through control over the external world and our significant others.</p>\n<p>The first images we internalize are the images of oneself as a body in the mirror, and what Jacques Lacan, a famous psychoanalyst, called the<em> Mirror Stage</em>. And then added to that self-image, is the gaze of the parents, other family members, the words they speak to you, the emotions they have toward you and each other&mdash;they all become enmeshed as internalized identity, a self-image surrounded with self-concepts that then becomes an operating system that separates from the original consciousness, and becomes a repressed unconscious system, ignorant of its true nature.</p>\n<p>The superconscious can contain a number of different levels. It contains higher understanding and feeling states, exultation, ecstasy, and awe, brilliant insights, our genius, our sense of wonder and astonishment, our capacity to feel infinitely expanded and one with all that is&mdash;all those potencies are located in the superconscious&mdash;but as we have said, the superconscious is a locus which is inaccessible to the ego. What many people access through drugs, or their imagination, is an imaginal realm that includes fantasies of what the superconscious is. Or if they do reach a threshold level of the superconscious, it is lost, and the information along with it, once one returns to normal waking consciousness.</p>\n<p>We use Freud&#8217;s analogy of an iceberg to show the proportions of the conscious mind to the subconscious mind. This is my version of an iceberg, and the conscious level is extremely small, meaning what we have access to in the conscious mind is very little. Most of the ego mind is subconscious. If we melt this iceberg and free up the energies bound up in fantasy structures, hidden from our conscious mind, within this lower part of the iceberg, we become one with the ocean again, the superconscious. So if we imagine erasing all of this, which would be erasing these two levels, we become this vast ocean.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we can state five key points to know when entering this work. The agency that controls the thoughts that appear in our mind against our will, the Censor, is the equivalent of the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency of the US government, that determines the information the government gives the public. But your conscious mind assumes that whatever appears is your own&mdash;is you&mdash;and this means that the ego is a state of unwitting self-hypnosis, in which the conscious mind is a persona created to satisfy the demands of others.</p>\n<p>2: Originally, one&#8217;s mind is hypnotized by the parents who give you a name and a persona with expectations and demands. You are indoctrinated from the outside to accept your ego, and then you learn to use your ego to do the same to others, to make demands on them, to hypnotize them, to seduce them, and manipulate them.</p>\n<p>2: The ego becomes a hypocrite but doesn&#8217;t know how much it is a hypocrite because it has repressed most of its knowledge of the fake nature of the ego itself. It can deceive itself into thinking it is being authentic when really it can no longer recognize authenticity, because it is coming from an inauthentic perspective. The ego is born in authenticity&mdash;it is the covering over of our original authenticity. And this is why people love to hang out with babies: because they&#8217;re still authentic, they&#8217;re innocent, and when they smile, they mean it. And we rarely see this in adults. Babies refresh our memory for our own innocence, but it doesn&#8217;t enable us to return to that innocence. And this is why Jesus said, &ldquo;Become like little children to enter the Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; because that innocence is the portal to the superconscious.</p>\n<p>It is painful for the ego to hear this and to realize it cannot change this from the level of the conscious mind, and this is why so many people that go to therapists can&#8217;t change their addictions or their patterns of desire&mdash;even if they don&#8217;t desire to desire them, they feel out of sync with their ego, and they don&#8217;t know how to control it. The ego is not able to reach the source of its suffering or its salvation, its subconscious or its superconscious.</p>\n<p>5: Because it cannot reach its Real Self (another name we use for the superconscious), it cannot deactivate the false self, which is this conscious/subconscious hybrid, and the false self has no interest in such deactivation. It causes one&#8217;s mind to have no interest in self-transcendence, or ego transcendence, or reaching the Real Self, and tries to convince you that there&#8217;s no Real Self to reach&mdash;and the conscious mind falls for it. But to whatever extent subconscious factors have bled into your life, and contaminate the imaginary happiness of the conscious mind, you will not be able to function or adapt without a countervailing power that comes only from the superconscious.</p>\n<p>Most people wait until they cannot manage the amount of unhappiness they are feeling. It is the sense of being overwhelmed that causes people to seek help. If you feel you are overwhelmed, the only way to get out&mdash;reach a higher level of consciousness. If you are at a beach and a tsunami is coming, you want to get to higher ground. Most people today are drowning in waves of emotion from the subconscious, and the only way to stay dry is to find the high ground of the superconscious. You will be free of suffering, and from that vantage point will be able to calm the ocean of consciousness and restore peace and order to your life and mind.</p>\n<p>The superconscious has hardly been mapped in the West, only mythologically and metaphorically within religion or the esoteric traditions like alchemy, but not psychologically. If you go back into the ancient world, they dealt with the superconscious in terms of myths, such as the Olympian myths and the Orphic myths, and then the philosophic myths, like Plato&#8217;s famous myth of the cave, or the myths of the gods in India. These myths, and the mystery schools they emerged from, that we spoke of in the beginning of the course, all contained symbols that were part of a system, understanding all three loci, and thus enabling one to reach the superconscious. The myths were teaching deep psychology put into code, and they are still valid today, if you can read the code. At a certain point, understanding of those myths was lost, their true meaning as signposts to the Real Self, and tremendously subtle information was lost along with it. The decoding of the myths was the work of the practitioners of the esoteric traditions, the wisdom schools that we spoke of in class one, that had to go underground or would have been persecuted by church and state. This knowledge has had to be hidden, and thus mostly lost.</p>\n<p>Once you have the key to decoding mythology, you will realize that it is the same key needed to decode dreams, and the information becomes obvious. Dreams are our private mythology, and the same logic is used to understand the myths, as well as dreams. Dreams are produced by the superconscious as messages to the conscious mind about the subconscious, as proof of the existence of the superconscious and its intelligence, and its love, and compassion for us in wanting to give our conscious mind the information to overcome the subconscious regressive tendencies.</p>\n<p>And the Western political order is based on keeping people&#8217;s psychology in a regressed state for purposes of control and manipulation. It has thus become normalized to be regressed in a weak, needy, uncritical mode of concrete thinking, that is filled with cognitive errors. The subconscious has been better mapped in the West than in the East, largely because it is originally a Western development. Now the East has been <em>Westernized</em> and has repressed the ancient traditions and simplicity of being. But in the West, there is more knowledge of the subconscious because of Freud and the early psychoanalysts, but very little Jungian, in Freudian analysis is happening, as we said in the last class, because few people have time for it, and everyone wants a quick fix, and extended therapy no longer receives much social validation. The bottom line is that we have to be willing to do the work to deconstruct the ego and its defenses in order to attain the prize of the superconscious.</p>\n<p>The result of spiritual processing is the unification of consciousness under the empowerment of the highest levels of consciousness, so that the entire consciousness is governed by the highest level having been activated and awakened. We have said that the ego deliberately creates a barrier between its conscious locus and its subconscious, and between the conscious and the superconscious&mdash;that barrier cuts off love and wisdom.</p>\n<p>The Censor is created early on, so the baby will not become destabilized. It allows the baby to fall asleep, so it stops crying. Then it learns to forget, to tune out and to deceive. The less it knows, the more denial it is in, and the more secure it feels. And this is why we have the clich&eacute; that ignorance is bliss&mdash;but the ignorance, at a certain point, creates an unmanageable psychic burden that may require professional help to unclog. The ego is always in lack, and on the edge of dysfunction, and at certain moments, crosses over the edge and finds itself in chaos. Only containment by the superconscious will provide lasting relief.</p>\n<p>In sum, we must harness and use the superconscious to align and transform the conscious and the subconscious. The superconscious will take over the conscious mind and then help purify the subconscious of its suffering, and bring order and health, and healing and wholeness to the entire consciousness.</p>\n<p>When we have achieved this, what we come to realize is that the ego itself is a structure of consciousness that is obsolete once one becomes an adult. In traditional societies there was a rite of passage that involved a vision quest, in which an ego death and a rebirth would take place and one usually accepts a new name and identity, a new function, often as a shaman in society, and lives from that point on in the superconscious&mdash;that becomes one&#8217;s new conscious mind, through a death and rebirth. But in modern society, this has been lost. There are no authentic spiritual rites of passage, so people never become true adults&mdash;they remain psychologically children. Now we have children raising children because no one has passed into the superconscious, and this is why we are studying all three loci, in order to bring order to our individual lives.</p>\n<p>We can see if we examine the news that the whole society is in chaos, and the same thing that happens in the microcosm of the ego happens in the planet at large, that leads to war and social unrest. If we can get our own ego&#8217;s house in order by putting it under the higher order of the superconscious, we can help the whole morphogenetic field of the planet to evolve, and enable human consciousness to be elevated, and return to a new state of conscious living that installs justice, peace, and the higher order of freedom and intelligence, so that we can survive the challenges that our species now faces.</p>\n<p>Namaste.</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Three-Loci-of-Mind.pdf">The Three Loci of Mind.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/38zrbu/Class_3_Final_Final-converted6jh2w.mp3">The Three Loci of Mind &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Journey through the three loci (centers or locations) which are also lokas (or realms) of mind: from the infernal subconscious, pass through the purgatory of the soul, and ascend to the empyrean heights of the superconscious.

It is installed in early childhood as a means to make a child obedient to parents and teachers and later becomes the instrument of social control via the media by the Big Other.</li><li>The ego is a larval structure of consciousness that is obsolete once one reaches puberty. In traditional societies, there were rites of passage through ego death into true adulthood. In current times, few people undergo such transformative ordeals, and thus remain psychologically immature throughout their lives.</li></ul><p>"The ego is structured this way is because it is an instrument of social adaptation, designed to direct a child to adapt to school and later to the social system that usually requires one to get a job or join an army, or get an advanced degree for reasons of prestige, actions that a more detached individual might otherwise think are foolish. The ego is designed to make you adapt to your family system and then the larger social order. This usually means becoming a docile sheep who follows the herd mentality and makes that way of living seem normal and sane, and any other ways of living to seem mad. Wisdom requires you to have the courage to separate from the herd, to think for yourself, to individuate, to become a leader, not a follower. Of course, now, during times that are no longer normal, the laws and the system itself is crazy making. So nearly everyone is in a state of cognitive dissonance. In other words, things don’t make sense."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p><p>The implications of the ego’s design include the following:</p><ul><li>the ego has no free will, although it believes it does</li><li>it cannot control its emotions or thoughts</li><li>it cannot individuate or develop its potentials without the validation of the Other</li><li>it can easily be bribed or coerced into cruel and immoral behavior</li><li>it tends to follow the herd and imitate what others are doing</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Unifying Our Consciousness</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>If we want the sovereignty, peace, joy, and empowerment that comes with Self-realization, we have to understand all the levels of our consciousness and undergo a vision quest, a transformational rite of passage, in which we leave behind the infantile ego.<br /><br />We can learn to connect to our superconscious power to purify the subconscious. The superconscious will then become the new locus of our conscious mind and bring divine order to our life.</p>	===LESSON_END===

The problem is that people do not know the real <em>I Am</em>, as they think they are the ego. And this Soy Burger will explain the structure of ego identity and show how it is a false construct that obstructs direct realization of our real nature: Atman, or Spirit.</p>\n<p>What we are showing today was the dominant structure of the modern period, a model similar to the one developed by Sigmund Freud. But we are now in a postmodern period, and the ego structure of the most recent generations has undergone some radical permutations that we will explore in our advanced courses. This is one reason why intergenerational communication can be so difficult, among other problems. Let us keep in mind that the ego is a fabrication, a temporal phenomenon that is culturally specific. The modern ego didn&#8217;t exist two thousand years ago, or even five hundred years ago, and therefore the old spiritual traditions could not offer accurate diagnoses of current ego forms, nor effective methods of transforming or transcending the modern or postmodern ego.</p>\n<p>So those ancient original teachings, although still valid with reference to the superconscious dimensions that we spoke of in the last class, they do not offer a model that enables most people to attain liberation from hypnotic capture by the ego. Because the ego was not a problem back then, there was no need for a solution. Teachers of the ancient world, whether called philosophers, shamans, yogis, roshis, or gurus, addressed an ego that was very simple in structure, and very simple to deconstruct, using simple tools like mantras, breathing exercises, or sacred rituals involving drumming, dancing, and chanting. So people back then could become enlightened very easily. This is no longer the case, and the ineffectiveness of the ancient paths has led to new alternative approaches, often involving the use of powerful psychedelic chemicals. But these also generally provide either a temporary glimpse of higher consciousness that wears off quickly, or can cause the destruction of the ego vehicle without bringing transcendence, but instead fragmenting the mind into psychosis.</p>\n<p>Our approach works naturally, but requires an intellectual grasp of one&#8217;s own psychic structure and conditioning, and a will to upgrade the program. The closer to the modern age we get, the more dominant over the soul and complex the ego becomes. In past historic eras, the soul was dominant, or at least still accessible, and could override the ego. Now, the mind has been indoctrinated to believe there is no soul, no higher vision or power to which one can link, and the ego-mind is less and less coherent, and less able to concentrate, or meditate, and thus unable to tune into the higher frequencies of mind that can bring inner peace, and access to wisdom. This has left most people lost, confused, and with a sense of meaninglessness and hopelessness, and nihilistic despair.</p>\n<p>But the ego level of mental activity can be transcended with practice and understanding. After all, the ego amounts only to an intricate network of thoughts based on false beliefs. While the real <em>I Am</em> is pure being, our own true nature, we can attune to the Real Self simply by silencing the ego chatter and focusing on the Source of awareness.</p>\n<p>In this class, we are showing you how to use the mind to analyze and redesign the mind itself. We must first awaken to the fact that consciousness abides as the witness of the ego. From the perspective of the silent witness, the ego is only a mental object. But if you, the witness, forget yourself and identify with thoughts, and thus with the ego, you identify as a bodily subject made of thoughts. You then become subjected to the ego and its incoherence. So the process of freeing yourself from the robotic thinking of the ego requires consistently recognizing the falsity of mental activity and its emotional accompaniment.</p>\n<p>The first goal of the spiritual process is to penetrate through the ego structure that functions as a mask, to discover who you really are. The ego is a mental formation that is split off from the Real Self, then itself becomes split into many different voices coming from childhood identifications, and internalization of parental voices, as well as deeper layers of mental images. Most of us have ended up with a seriously fragmented mind, which also generally results in conflicted and deadlocked will, and this makes change very difficult.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s begin with our diagram. Your original Self is pure Awareness, and we use this whiteboard as an analogy, to that the pure Emptiness that is actually pure Fullness, and filled with absolute potentiality. This pure Awareness, which is also the definition of the Real Self, is without identity. And the first thing that I want to represent is the womb of a mother&mdash;that&#8217;s what this circle is representing&mdash;the womb of a female, a particular female who became your particular mother. What incarnates into a womb? The yogis of ancient times called it a <em>jyoti bindu</em>, which is translated literally as a &ldquo;point of light&rdquo;. So this jyoti bindu is what you first are when you incarnate. But, actually, part of our consciousness incarnates into a fetal body, that is in a womb of a particular mother, the rest remains part of the superconscious.</p>\n<p>Jyoti bindu is, as I said, one of the old yogic terms for the energy of consciousness that activates and enlivens, and becomes the consciousness of the organism that is to be born. It is a point of light which is actually the endpoint of a ray of light, that comes from the central sun of consciousness, and connects us back to our Source. So if we imagine the Absolute Supreme Consciousness represented as the sun, this gives off a ray of light that then becomes an individual jyoti bindu in an organism.</p>\n<p>In Sat Yoga, we use the analogy of the Euclidean point of no-dimensionality<em>,</em> which is a mathematical term, as well as the term jyoti bindu, the Sanskrit term, which is the traditional understanding of it. Actually, Shunyamurti says that geometry came out of the fact that consciousness itself is a point of light with no dimensions, and you could realize that the dimensions of space were projections of consciousness. Everything starts from a point, then the point connects to another point, and you have a line, your first dimension, and so on. The Euclidean point of no-dimensionality is an analog to the reality&mdash;the point contains everything in its awareness, because it is boundless awareness but occupies no space.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, the problem is, we are born into the body of a specific mother, a being who has its own limited consciousness, that is, an already formed ego who will impose and project into the fetus its own fantasies, desires, demands, anxieties, and intentions such that the infant, or the fetus&#8217;s, free will to determine its own ego identity is already influenced to fit itself into this context, in which it finds itself helplessly at the mercy of the mother&#8217;s body and mind. So, in essence, we are formed through the mind, and later the eyes, of another from the moment we incarnate.</p>\n<p>What we come to feel as &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, as &ldquo;who I am&rdquo;, is always a set of images and feelings that derive from the initial relationships of life, with the containing others who gave one a name and a role in the family system. The first traumas can happen <em>in utero</em>, what we call the level of intrauterine fantasies, when we are affected by mother&#8217;s anxieties, creating a great deal of discomfort. The fetus knows, for example, if it is growing into a female and the mother possibly wants a son, or there may be a conflict with the father, or she might want to abort. In this sense, the body&#8217;s karmic trajectory might be at odds with the desire of the mother, or of both parents. These conflicts will show up before birth, in particular, if the mother is ambivalent about giving birth, and it can cause a deadening of consciousness before birth happens, as early as this moment in one&#8217;s incarnation. In the process, Atman is forgotten, abandoned from conscious awareness, and one is then ignorant that one is a being of light.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti teaches us that Atman, Spirit, is the uncreated, unborn Self, that is the ultimate source and intelligence that gives forth a subset of itself as the soul, and a subset of the soul as the ego, that forms the operating system of the body. Jyoti bindu is the light, the battery, the life force, that receives energy and information from Atman to operate the body, receives specifically a current of energy and information flow from the Atman. Because the mother sees us through the filter of her projections, all of this is dropped from consciousness, and you will require a spiritual teacher later in life to remind you of what you had forgotten.</p>\n<p>This creates the first act of censorship that will control our life until we go through a rite of passage, such as this initiation into Sat Yoga, as the Censor comes into being from this moment on, until such a rite of passage is complete. So we depict this censor on this diagram as this oval that&#8217;s to represent the meat of the burger. And the Censor ends up taking the place of where the jyoti bindu is supposed to be in our consciousness&mdash;as the center of our consciousness&mdash;but is placed in the farthest reaches of our consciousness. And we draw this by putting it at the bottom of the diagram, so that we can see that Atman or Spirit or the jyoti bindu, has no longer a central place in our ego structure, but is foreclosed, is placed in the farthest reaches of consciousness where, once this is created, we can no longer access it, unless we do a deep process such as Sat Yoga, that can retrieve this Atman once again.</p>\n<p>And the bottom line in terms of this aspect of the creation of the Censor, is that the mother sees only her projections on a flesh and blood baby, not this point of light that you actually are. And this being&#8217;s past lives are repressed then in order to adapt to the current situation. Seen from the perspective of Atman, which is also all of this outside of the burger, this light of the jyoti bindu that comes from Atman, activates the brain, the central nervous system, and causes the flow of electromagnetic energy, also known as <em>prana</em> or <em>chi</em>, that we will go into in class five, and connects and communicates with all the cells of the body, creating the sense of a unified presence operating the organism. <em>Maya</em>, or illusion, is when this light meets fantasies that act as filters, and produces a life that is an illusory projection of those fantasies. The jyoti bindu doesn&#8217;t contain any fantasies, so if you can return to the jyoti bindu, you can get out of maya. Just trace the ray of light back to its original source and voila, you are free: liberation is yours.</p>\n<p>When the child realizes that it is seen only in a particular way, that it must accommodate to that in order to get along with the mother, and feel secure in her love, then one acquiesces in becoming what she desires. And this solidifies the Censor that creates a split mind, comprised of a conscious level, a Censor, and a subconscious. Conscious mind, the upper part of the burger, the Censor, and then everything below the Censor is the subconscious.</p>\n<p>This split mind keeps one from knowing too clearly the fact that there are aspects of one&#8217;s consciousness that are unseen and unloved. And on top of that, one has to then become out of touch with both one&rsquo;s superconsciousness and one&#8217;s subconscious. And one&#8217;s conscious mind is limited to trying to make sure it remains the object of the mother&#8217;s desire, and therefore it gives up control of its own psyche to a censoring agency that manages its anxiety. In essence, the Censor replaces the superconscious. The Censor is responsible for why people cannot achieve their goals in life, as it obscures the white light. The ego thus acts like a prism that splits the beam: part is conscious, that smallest tip of the iceberg that we spoke of in the last class, but most is in control of a Censor, which determines how much the conscious mind will receive of information and will, and the rest is suppressed into the subconscious.</p>\n<p>This splitting of consciousness also creates a sense of lack, weakness, and bewilderment. One rarely knows what is going on, why one is doing what one is doing, or feeling. One feels carried along by internal forces, and emotions, and drives that one cannot control. And in essence, one is in the dark as to the forces that control one&#8217;s own psyche.</p>\n<p>So now let&#8217;s explore further the content of the subconscious. We depict each layer of the subconscious as a standing wave of energy, and I do that through drawing these wavy lines, representing lines of information. And the deepest layers that I&#8217;ll draw below the burger, are left over from previous lifetimes. What we usually access first are the intrauterine layers, and these are the layers from before you were born, which also include the layers of input from the current collective unconscious, which comes to you from the social order, first via the parents. Then there are the personal layers of the subconscious, and these are the three layers that comprise the Soy Burger proper. In other words, all three levels are imposed upon the consciousness that you are, and they also include the leftover residues from past lives that configure the desires of this lifetime. And those are these deepest layers I&#8217;ve written down here, which we call <em>sanskaras</em>; this is a Sanskrit term for standing waves of energy.</p>\n<p>The personal level of the subconscious fantasy has to do with your personal take on the events of your childhood, and history, and the premature conclusions you drew about reality that were mixed with childhood terrors and desires. It includes fantasies surrounding birth, such as passing through the birth canal, but also difficulties with birth. For example, medical problems you might have had, a c-section, or an abortion might have been attempted. Each of these kinds of events have profound impacts because they are repressed, prior to your having language to think about them&mdash;meaning you probably know nothing about them except for the effect they have on your state of inner peace, and how they create symptoms in your body.</p>\n<p>The fantasies at this level also include those around breastfeeding, weaning, and your role in the family system. All these trigger attitudes you have later in life, without knowing their subconscious roots. Your infantile self is extremely aware of all the nuances of the parents&rsquo; relationship, the mother&#8217;s level of anxiety, the presence of siblings, the extended family system, the economic situation of your family, and other factors that you have no conscious memory of, yet the effects are no doubt still with you.</p>\n<p>The content of the collective fantasies pertains to the cultural matrix of your particular society that dictates what is of value: what is it all about? The whole context and meaning of life as regards what is the purpose of life, and why are you alive? All these ideas come from the collective as well as from the fantasies that are individual and particular at the personal level. This internal subconscious command system holds you in a sense of inferiority or superiority, that then the Censor works to maintain to keep you feeling in equilibrium with a very distorted and outdated sense of who you are. But since, within the ego, it is the ground of your being, you hold onto it for a sense of stability. And this is why we must access the true ground of our being&mdash;the Atman.</p>\n<p>Within each ego are several superegos; these are the judgmental and seductive voices and attitudes, implanted by parental influence. And the conscious mind is split between ego and superego. So within this upper sector, we have the maternal and the paternal superego voice, which themselves are also split into an angelic and a demonic voice&mdash;angelic and demonic according to the way the child perceives these voices. So, for example, you may break something, you might drop the cookie jar as a child, and your mother gets extremely angry and yells at you, and every time throughout your childhood, you drop something, all of a sudden there&#8217;s an angry voice attacking you for this kind of action, because the child&#8217;s mind is not able to discern that this is a voice coming from the mother, and that it doesn&#8217;t need to hold onto this voice every time something drops. That would be the more demonic side of the voice, but at the same time, you might do something that is very pleasing to the mother, and she takes you into her arms and gives you love, because you drew a beautiful picture. And then every time you produce some kind of artwork, there&#8217;s a voice inside your head that says, &ldquo;You are wonderful for doing this,&rdquo; and these voices end up controlling us into adulthood.</p>\n<p>But what it ultimately means is that within the conscious mind level, your ego is not whole. It is divided between actually what turns out to be four voices in the conscious mind, and then there&#8217;s the subconscious, the repressed side of these same voices. And it turns out that we end up having eight superego internalized voices of mother and father. These are always judging you, commanding you, or telling you what you should do, or to, &ldquo;Do as I do, but not as I say,&rdquo; which is more in the subconscious, or to, &ldquo;Do as I say, not as I do,&rdquo; which is more in the conscious level.</p>\n<p>They can, in some people, become a very tormenting set of energies that can produce unending traumatized states. In some, the pathological forces of the subconscious create paranoia, and the only way to defeat this is by accessing the superconscious Self, and deactivating this ego. And again, the superconscious being represented by the empty whiteboard. This is why most religious people pray, and others meditate, in order to receive power from beyond the ego, to stop its paranoid process and bring inner peace. The Censor hides the Real Self from awareness. It uses anxiety, addictions, attention deficit, sleepiness, and other habitual modes of distraction to keep awareness from connecting with the Self.</p>\n<p>Says Shunyamurti: &ldquo;This internal subconscious command system holds one in a sense of inferiority and/or superiority. Whatever the case, there&#8217;s always dissatisfaction. Yet the internal Censor creates ego defenses that prevent the liberation of consciousness from the limited self-concept.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is how the burger emits a parasol, a force field, or an energy field, around all three parts of the ego structure, that keeps you from getting information, and why people remain stupid and in denial. And I&#8217;ll depict those force fields with these dotted lines. They each prevent information getting into the subconscious, into the Censor, and prevent information getting into the conscious mind because of the Censor. Thus, one can remain psychologically crippled, in a pseudo-equilibrium that contains the infantile terrors, the core paranoia of the ego, as well as its hate and aggression, and the decisions to cut large portions of one&#8217;s potential personality off in order to fit in with the family system. The rite of passage that we have mentioned would dissolve the subconscious system that contains this programming, and redesign your own operating system to serve your own goals in life, and hopefully coming from your Real Self to serve your soul&#8217;s real mission in this life, that you may not yet even know.</p>\n<p>So, how do we begin this transformation process? First, you learn to recognize the Censor within yourself&mdash;this part of the ego structure&mdash;and gradually come to overpower it. And this can happen only when you want to know everything that is in your subconscious and superconscious. Spiritual transformation is about building the capacity to handle knowing everything within your mind and facing its implications. Once the repressed subconscious is worked through, you will see it as all fantasy, unreal, maya, and you will be able to let it go and return to wholeness and unity of consciousness.</p>\n<p>To return to this wholeness and unity of consciousness, one of the first keys that we need is to understand our dreams that come from Atman. They come from this deepest level of our being, which is also the highest level of our being, and it is the level of our pure intelligence. Every night, Atman sends us many dreams, and they usually get scrambled by the Censor, just as the CIA or other government agencies will scramble the information coming from the so-called &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; during wartime. The Censor operates in the same way for us, and usually what ends up appearing in our conscious mind is a symbol&mdash;something like a palm tree, that we have no idea what it means, because the direct information has been obscured by the Censor, but also by these other fantasy levels.</p>\n<p>And so we have to work with someone who knows deeply and truly how to understand all of these different levels of information, as well as understand what each particular dream is trying to teach us in the particular moment that we find ourselves in, so that we can make the next step towards liberation. We also need to recognize how these particular fantasies, the intrauterine, the collective, and the personal, create interference patterns and break up the flow of will from Atman&mdash;because Atman is not just intelligence, it is also pure will&mdash;and as this will tries to emerge each moment in our life, it is obstructed by these interference patterns of the information levels that we have not worked through yet. And this leaves one depleted and unable to move forward. But with the power of knowledge that we are giving right now at this moment, about this structure, one already can access a fuller flow of energy that is available immediately for transcendence of the false identity. Meaning, at any moment if you know that what you are is actually this flow of intelligence and will from Atman, and it&#8217;s simply being obstructed by all of these fantasy layers&mdash;and you know it&mdash;all you need to do is disidentify from it, and you can immediately touch into the pure, Fullness and Emptiness of vast consciousness.</p>\n<p>The ego is the larval state of consciousness&mdash;this ego structure&mdash;to become a true adult one must dissolve it. One must dissolve the ego, and thus gain the power to live a life of true wholeness, nobility, joyous, fulfillment, and Self-realization. And this is what the Sat Yoga approach to spiritual development is designed to help you attain. To a true adult, the ego is an obsolete remnant from infancy, and is the cause of suffering. The first wise decision is to be free of the ego, to be free of this structure&mdash;enter the cocoon of inner silence, to go through the sacred metamorphosis, and soon you will fly autonomously as an empowered being of light, and lead a beautiful life of creative intelligence, authentic self-expression and sublime value. Blessing on achieving this goal of this great work.</p>\n<p>Namaste.</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Structure-of-the-Ego.pdf">The Structure of the Ego.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/4uwzqz/Class_4_Final_Final-convertedah6hr.mp3">The Structure of the Ego &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Uncover the structure of false consciousness that was installed in childhood and confront the nefarious censor that impedes your higher development—so you can upgrade your consciousness and achieve inner freedom, divine love, and creative genius.</p><ul><li>Discover the structure of the ego and learn how subconscious fantasies covertly rule your life.</li></ul><ul><li>Deconstruct the censoring mechanism that limits critical thinking, intuition, and higher creativity, and keeps game-changing information from entering your mind.</li></ul><ul><li>Recognize the importance and feasibility of developing your supernormal potentials and accessing the superconscious.</li></ul>	===LESSON_END===
===LESSON_START===	664	===TITLE===	4.2 Key Concepts	===SLUG===	4-2-key-concepts	===ORDER===	14	===CONTENT===	<h2>The Evolution of the Ego</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ul><li>The ego is a cultural artifact, a temporal phenomenon that varies in structure, complexity, orientation and attitudes through time and is specific not only to a given social order, but changes in every subculture and every generation.</li><li>The current postmodern ego did not exist 2,000 years ago—or even 500 years ago—and therefore the old spiritual traditions cannot offer accurate diagnoses or treatment of current forms of egoic malaise, nor effective methods of transforming or transcending the contemporary versions of the human ego.</li><li>The closer to the modern period we get, the more complex and fragile the ego becomes.</li><li>Over time, the ego mind has become more fragmented and thus less and less coherent, less able to concentrate or meditate, more prone to mental disorders, and with an attention deficit and self-attacking tendency that leaves one unable to attune to the higher frequencies of consciousness that bring inner peace, wisdom, and grace.</li></ul><p>"The first goal of the spiritual process is to penetrate through the ego structure that functions as a mask, to discover who you really are."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Creation of the Censor</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>One of the old yogic terms for the luminous energy of consciousness that activates, enlivens, and organizes the consciousness of the organism is the <strong>jyoti bindu</strong>—which means a point of light—the end point of a ray of divine light that comes from the central Sun of consciousness and connects us back to our Source.</p><ul><li>This <em>jyoti bindu</em> lights up the brain of a fetal body in a womb, and starts the quickening that creates movement in the body and awareness in the dreaming unborn mind.</li><li>In the process, the Atman is forgotten and consciousness adapts to its new environment. Consciousness becomes ignorant of its real nature as a being of light.</li><li>Through a series of prenatal difficulties climaxing in the birth trauma, the censoring agency takes control, defending the vulnerable mind from terror, and keeps the consciousness imprisoned in false frame of reference. To free ourselves, we must undergo a rite of passage such as this initiation into Sat Yoga.</li></ul><p>"The problem is we are born into the body of a specific mother, a being who has its own limited consciousness that is an already formed ego who will impose and project into the fetus its own fantasies, desires, demands, anxieties, and intentions, such that the infant or the fetus’s free will to determine its own ego identity is already influenced to fit itself into this context in which it finds itself, helplessly at the mercy of the mother’s body and mind."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Split of the Conscious Mind</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>After birth, the conscious mind of the infant becomes focused on trying to make sure it remains the primary object of the mother’s desire and attention, and therefore it internalizes her as a superego that imitates her and fantasizes that “I and the Mother are one.” The ego soon hardens into a system of behavioral algorithms. Some of the changes that take place include the following:</p><ul><li>The <strong>censor</strong> replaces and represses the superconscious. It becomes the locus of the superego, through which the conscious mind is controlled.</li><li>The censor is responsible for keeping people in denial of what it considers inconvenient aspects of reality, and thus limits one’s ability to respond to change.</li><li>The ego acts like a prism that splits the light beam: part is conscious, part subconscious, and the censor controls how much information passes from one to the other, and therefore how well one understands oneself.</li><li>The conscious mind is a war zone, with conflicting inner child feelings and <strong>superego voices</strong>: both judgmental and seductive demands of the internalized mother and father, and their attitudes implanted as commands. Within each ego, eight superego voices can usually be heard.</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Returning to Wholeness</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>We must use our intelligence to analyze and re-design our mental software. We must awaken to the fact that soul consciousness abides deeper within as the witness and master of the ego.<br /><br />The process of freeing yourself from the robotic thinking patterns of the ego requires consistently recognizing the axioms and beliefs underlying our mental activity and its emotional accompaniment.<br /><br />This is what the Sat Yoga approach to psychospiritual development is designed to help you attain.</p><p>"Spiritual transformation is about building the capacity to handle knowing everything within your mind and facing its implications. Once the repressed subconscious is worked through, you will see it is all fantasy, unreal, Maya, and you will be able to let it go, and return to wholeness and unity of Consciousness."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>	===LESSON_END===

Today, we will be discussing the seven bodies that exist within consciousness, and to begin we must define the terms we will be using. The seven bodies include the traditional five sheaths, or <em>mayakoshas</em>, which are known to all students of yoga. I&#8217;ll put that word on the board for you.</p>\n<p>These comprise the different layers of our being that are also known as organism, ego, and soul. The concept of mayakosha is a combination of two words made up of the idea of illusion, <em>maya</em>, and <em>kosha</em>, which is a sheath. Every appearance is an illusion, but some illusions are more subtle than others. The grossest and most dense kosha is the physical organism that is nourished by food, so it is called the &ldquo;food body&rdquo;. Then, at a more subtle level, we can feel our vital energy, and as we move more inwardly, we observe the thinking mind. Even deeper within is the discerning intellect, and deeper than that, we reach the state of peace we usually only touch into in deep sleep. In some, the koshas range from the most gross to the most subtle, and we perceive a graduated series of sheaths, like nested dolls, going ever more deeply inward toward the imperceptibility of these most subtle sheaths.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;The idea of a sheath is also equivalent to a veil. Each veil covers over a more subtle veil until we reach the untouched, pure reality of Absolute Consciousness that the Vedanta philosophers call Brahman. Once Brahman is realized as oneself, then the illusions of maya are all overcome, and the world, and all the layers of consciousness that construct the world, and apperceive it, are recognized as a single spectrum of consciousness that is a single intelligence expressing its infinite creativity. In other words, maya, or appearance, is the way that a particular subset of information, set apart from the source and infinite wholeness of the total set of information that makes up reality, manifests to a given level of itself as a particular phenomenon, or series of phenomena. That is, all maya means&mdash;the way that a temporary phenomenon is created through the projection of a representation of the ineffable information, that constitutes the holographic display that we call the world, along with the production of ideas&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>We get our thoughts from personal memory as well as the stored database of the collective noetic field, which is often referred to as the Akashic records. Sometimes we also get higher ideas from the superconscious levels. In other words, the wisdom sheath conveys an insight to the mental sheath. But our perceptions of reality always combine elements from all the levels. The superconscious provides the forms of Nature with a capital &ldquo;N&rdquo;, and the mental sheath, also known as the ego, adds into the projection of the world its own subconscious fantasies, and conscious expectations, and paranoid fears. Thus, at the ego level, we perceive only a distorted interpretation of the information that comprises the reflection of reality, and unless we eliminate the factors that distort our perception, by processing the false ideas that make up the ego&#8217;s particular maya, which produces karma, we can never perceive reality as it truly is.</p>\n<p>In addition to the koshas, we have two other kinds of body. One that represents our consciousness through time, and the other that constitutes the consciousness that underlies all that appears in space-time as a totality. The individual transtemporal body&mdash;meaning that level of consciousness that stays with us from one lifetime to another, and that survives death and eventually returns to its Source&mdash;we consider a single thread, a soul trajectory that holds all our lifetimes together as a whole, in the same way that a thread holds all the beads of a necklace together.</p>\n<p>In Sanskrit, the word for thread is <em>sutra</em>. So the consciousness of our individual journey through time is called the <em>sutratma</em>, which is also a combination of thread&mdash;the word &ldquo;suture&rdquo; comes from sutra&mdash;and <em>Atma</em>, and in this case Atma refers to soul-consciousness, not the Absolute Self. But then at the most all-encompassing level, we eventually come to realize the seventh body, the <em>Mahasutratma</em>. <em>Maha</em> means great, and of course, then this is the &ldquo;great thread&rdquo;, or the through line of the entire tapestry of time that contains the entire cosmos from beginning to end. And by connecting the end, the Omega point, to the beginning, makes the world eternal.</p>\n<p>We will explore the nature of these seven bodies more in depth in a moment, but first I will write them on the board so that the terms and the relationships between them are clear.</p>\n<p>The vertical axis is where you are now, located in space, and contains all five sheaths. And again, remember from our previous classes, this is still also the vertical dimension, and the depth dimension, but we&#8217;re adding a new set of concepts, of course, to this. And this horizontal line is still time, but of course, now with the sutratma and the Mahasutratma mapped on it.</p>\n<p>So the <em>annamayakosha</em> is the &ldquo;food body&rdquo; or the sheath of food. The <em>pranamayakosha</em> refers to the bioelectromagnetic energy, the vital energy that keeps your organism alive, even more than food. The <em>manomayakosha</em> is the &ldquo;mental body&rdquo;. <em>Mano</em> comes from <em>manas</em> (mind), and this refers to the ordinary thinking mind of the ego, the operating system of the organism. And then we have the <em>vigyanamayakosha</em>. So <em>gyana</em> means spiritual knowledge. It&#8217;s also referred to as <em>gnosis</em> in Greek, and it is knowledge of the Self, knowledge that you gain by directly realizing the Self, by entering into the deepest level of consciousness beyond language. And <em>vigyana</em> means &ldquo;beyond knowledge&rdquo;, which is wisdom. So the vigyanamayakosha is our wisdom body, the level of consciousness within us that somehow intuitively knows our true nature: the right way to live, is able to listen to the voice of the heart, that voice that comes from the innermost silence.</p>\n<p>And on the horizontal axis, the axis of time, as I said, we find the sutratma and the Mahasutratma. The sutratma contains the information flow that connects your current life to your past and future lives, so that at every moment, if you focus on the right level, you have access to all information from all time. And the Mahasutratma is the entire database of the holographic appearance of the universe. This is accessible if you attune to the right frequency, and such attunement enables you to receive information from the cosmic level of consciousness. Beyond all the seven bodies, including that of the cosmos, is the Real Self. So again, we use the empty whiteboard to represent that beyond, and of course, behind and pervading it, this absolute consciousness that we ultimately are. Your Real Self is also the Self of the universe, which you will discover if&mdash;and only if&mdash;you are willing and able to rise to that level of your being.</p>\n<p>The dense food sheath I will put here. Food enables you to be fully present here and now in this moment in spacetime, as an embodied being receiving the full intensity of information that constitutes phenomenal existence and its impermanence. But you can also tune into the higher koshas, which are the link to the timelessness, and to the Self that you are beyond the universe&mdash;these higher koshas&mdash;the Self who is dreaming all of this, and determining the course of destiny, of your individual journey, and ultimately of every being.</p>\n<p>Knowledge of the seven bodies can clarify for you the source of any condition that shows up in your life that causes suffering, whether it is a condition in your outer life, a physical symptom of disease, or it shows up in your mind as emotional instability, or obsessive thinking, or a condition that disturbs your sleep, or makes it difficult to meditate, or causes the same kinds of unhappy situations to arise again and again in your life&mdash;you can trace the cause to one of these seven bodies if you understand the cascading relationship between them, you will know how to deal with whatever disturbance is occurring.</p>\n<p>It should be obvious that most of our troubles are caused by thoughts and emotions in the mental body, the manomayakosha. The mind projects its negative energy into the pranic body, which in turn produces symptoms in the physical body. You need to activate the wisdom body in order to fix the problem. I&#8217;ll also put these on the board for you. Wisdom, and again, this is the bioelectromagnetic energy. From the wisdom body you will also know how to raise your consciousness even higher because it partakes of the highest sheath of bliss. The most sublime and exalting experiences will come when we have activated our awareness of the Mahasutratma, here.</p>\n<p>We are not conscious of that level of our reality when we are still in the ego, which again is the manomayakosha. The ego can only perceive and care about the small sliver of information that concerns its personal pleasure and pain. You could call it the ego&#8217;s &ldquo;reality tunnel&rdquo;, as Robert Anton Wilson did.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;The ego-mind perceives time as a linear succession of events. It is identified with the physical organism as it appears at each moment, and with its context, its immediate life world, or <em>umwelt</em>, as it is called by the ethologists. But when you are able to disidentify from the organism whose life is unfolding in time, and realize the timeless presence that lies deeper within, you will realize that you are dreaming all that happens, and you will be able to awaken from that dream, and merge into the mind of the absolute Dreamer, which is your ultimate Self.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So that total realization, that full empowerment, that supreme liberation, is the goal of this teaching. Through the practice of meditation, you can gradually increase your capacity for activating your awareness of the information located in the higher levels of your being, and this will enable you to integrate all levels of being. In the past, you may have not even been aware of the higher levels because of the ego&#8217;s will to ignorance. Once you work free of attachment to the lower bodies, the access to the higher and more beautiful and blissful sheaths that confer wisdom and power are yours to play with.</p>\n<p>The koshas contain all the nested levels of knowledge that can create both connection and disconnection between the Source of our infinite being and the manifestation of the particular finite human being, with which one is currently identified. These sheaths are the vehicles through which our complete being can manifest its potencies coherently, in the phenomenal plane as a microcosm, right? This is a single incarnation of one being with five sheaths, and the world is a school, in which we gradually learn to align all seven bodies in a conscious way, to maximize goodness, beauty, love, joy, and truth.</p>\n<p>But to do that, we must awaken and activate those bodies as powers of the Self. So long as there&#8217;s identification with the physical organism, this and this, and its egoic mind, awakening and empowerment cannot happen. Thus, our practice must be to let the gross body identification fall away, as well as the mental identifications coming from the manomayakosha to turn inward to the pure presence to whom all the bodies pertain. When connection to the inmost intelligence has been attained, then there can be union with that ineffable presence, and this is Sat Yoga. On the way to this goal, it is helpful to focus on the wisdom body level, to receive accurate understanding, and to use that knowledge to connect with the bliss body and then to the Real Self beyond.</p>\n<p>By connecting all the sheaths to each other and to the Self, we enable communication from the subtlest level, which is up here, to the gross body level, down at the bottom, and thus to open the floodgates of divine love, and supernal light, the highest wisdom, and limitless spiritual power. Without that connectivity of all levels of our being, we remain zombies and not fully alive. Consciousness and the uncanny energy from the Source that flows from beyond all the sheaths, enables one to convert the world into the realm of the miraculous. This is why religions say that the Kingdom of God is within, and that the Kingdom of Heaven is here, but you do not see it, as Christ said in the Gospel of Thomas.</p>\n<p>The ancient yogis knew all this. They mapped the seven bodies thousands of years ago. But the map is not the territory, and though this knowledge has remained an open secret, very few souls have had the courage and strength to use the information to gain liberation. Shunyamurti says that, &ldquo;Today we know that science also confirms much of this knowledge. If we are able to connect the dots and put together the latest teachings of quantum physics, starting with entanglement and uncertainty, with the accurate understanding of the role played by electromagnetism as well as antimatter, and if we understand that the root of all is consciousness, and we connect the findings of psychoanalysis, archetypal psychology, parapsychology, the placebo effect in medicine, and the proven power of meditation, then we can easily understand how to liberate ourselves from limited levels of being.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So the annamayakosha, the modus operandi of the gross sheath, is to provide a durable, percipient experiencing vehicle, able to digest and assimilate chemical nutrients, and to function to satisfy the desires of the operator. The organism moves through spacetime and tries to accomplish its aims. One of its aims may be to reproduce other such bodies so that other rays of consciousness can become embodied, but the organism by itself has no intentions. It must be animated by the presence of a soul, a luminous spark that is the endpoint of a ray of divine light from the Source, which functions like a central sun&mdash;as we spoke of in the prior class&mdash;and this permeates all the sheaths.</p>\n<p>The food sheath contains the genetic information that enables the construction and maintenance of the physical body, which requires food, the earth element, water, and air, all the five basic elements that make up reality on this plane. Today&#8217;s allopathic medical system has expensive high technology, but a very low level of understanding of the real cause of illness, and therefore has very little effectiveness in dealing with many disorders, including cancer and heart disease, and too many other severe illnesses that all have a psychosomatic component. But because modern medicine deals only with the material body and assumes that every problem is chemical or physiological, it cannot reach the real causes, which are mental and emotional.</p>\n<p>Traditional Chinese medicine treats the pranic body and has often had more success, but that still does not reach the root of most symptoms. Because most people have been indoctrinated into believing that they are material beings whose brains somehow produce consciousness through the complex electrochemical activity of neurons, there&#8217;s little curiosity about the deeper meanings of our symptoms of suffering, and because of our ignorance, we continue to suffer. Some medical treatments are worse than the original illness, but because we believe life is random and meaningless, and that we are mortal bodies in danger of being blotted out by death, we live in fear, and submit to control by society, by the medical establishment, and other modes of intimidation.</p>\n<p>Because we are stuck in the mental body, identified with the food body, and are not in touch with the wisdom body, nor do we have the peace of the highest body of bliss, we have lost the real power of self-healing. We are not able to stabilize the pranic body, and thus we are not able to be free of stress and anxiety. Furthermore, the food body is the only body most people recognize and identify with. It is what we see in the mirror, what we hear, smell, taste, touch, and because we are identified with the physical organism, we are saturated with its intensity of stimuli, its memories, the projections imposed upon it, the demands made on it, the traumas it suffered, and the enjoyment it once knew in the past, that it yearns to repeat.</p>\n<p>The food body has a skeleton, bones, muscles, blood, organs, bacteria that support its functioning, reproductive emissions, sweat, waste, matter, etc.&mdash;all the elements that constitute the organism function according to a logic governed by physiology and chemistry, but also by quantum level factors, so the organism is dependent on the physics of the material situation that we are in, the physical environment. We need air to breathe, sunlight, and so on, but the food body is also the site in which emanations from the mental body take effect. Bam!</p>\n<p>Subconscious meanings are deposited there as symptoms, calling out to be deciphered. It is important, then, to recognize and know that our <em>Soy Burger</em>, <em>I am</em> Burger from the prior class, is right here when we are in egoic consciousness at the center of our graph, and here is our Censor right in the middle of it all. But meaning is not a concept that falls within the purview of medical doctors&rsquo; usual pursuit of the cause of a disease. The annamayakosha is taken out of context and isolated by the medical approach, as if the physical body is a being, while in fact it is only a small part of our entire beingness.</p>\n<p>The second sheath is more subtle but still material, the pranamayakosha. Prana was known by the traditional Chinese healers and is the basis of their treatment modality of acupuncture. Prana is known more famously in the West as <em>Qi</em>, it&#8217;s Chinese equivalent, and the substance is now known to science as bioelectromagnetic energy, as we said already. This life energy comes partially from chemical nourishment, but mostly from two sources. One is the biophotons that we get directly from the sun when we sunbathe, and that we also get in our food that gets there via photosynthesis by plants that we eat. The second way that we get those biophotons is from within, from the Source of our consciousness. When our consciousness feels love, that vibrates in the body as life energy, it produces electrical effects in the body that are communicated to all our cells via the water molecules throughout the organism. The more we meditate and fill our souls with divine love and light, the more that gets converted into biophotonic energy. It produces a radiance that we can feel and that others can feel. That energy can also be transmitted through thought, and thus we are capable of enabling remote healing effects to occur. There is a whole science of prana and its dissemination that we will cover in more advanced courses.</p>\n<p>The traditional healers since ancient times knew that if a body is drained of its prana, its bioelectrical energy, it quickly becomes a dead corpse. Prana is the energy that actually runs the body, not the food. Sugars can spike the energy levels, as can other chemicals that stimulate endocrine activity, but the basic life energy is prana. Even to digest food, you require electricity. If you want to drive a car, gasoline is needed, but if you don&#8217;t have a battery, you will not have the electricity to start up your car. The electrical aspect is like the battery, and you can&#8217;t drive a car without a battery. Likewise, if your life battery runs low, you will feel depressed, without energy, and even though you may take your vitamins and eat well, the organism&#8217;s state of wellbeing requires equilibrium in the mental body that governs the pranic flow. In a state of negative emotionality, the prana is drained, and the body will either enter a flight or fight mode, using up its energy reserves, or will become weak and subject to fainting, because of the lack of prana.</p>\n<p>The pranic body is a field of vital energy flowing through a complex system of subtle pathways called <em>nadis</em>, which literally means &ldquo;rivers&rdquo;&mdash;in the acupuncture terminology they are called <em>meridians</em>, that network of energy current not only connects all the trillions of cells of the body into a single energy system, but communicates information to them, and coordinates their activities.</p>\n<p>The pranamayakosha is thus a very important factor in healing that Western medicine does not understand or address. The pranamayakosha&rsquo;s energy field not only pervades the body, but also surrounds it as an aura. The aura is part of our psychic immune system. When strong, it keeps negative psychic energies from invading the body, in the same way that the magnetosphere of the earth keeps the electromagnetic poles stable, and protects the planet from various incoming forms of radiation that could otherwise be fatal to our lives. Our psychic immune system requires a very healthy, pranic aura. If we don&#8217;t have that, we are liable to suffer many illnesses as a result, and the practice of Sat Yoga will strengthen the aura and help to order the energy distribution of the organism, and enable the life energies to flow in an accurate way.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of prana is to communicate the orders from the next higher body, the mental, to the physical organism, to serve as a liaison, a communication network that connects mind to the brain, and central and peripheral nervous systems of the annamayakosha. But if the mental body is split, is in a state of internal conflict, then this too will be transmitted to the physical body and produce dysfunctional nervous effects there. So Shunyamurti teaches us that the beliefs, thoughts, drives, and emotions, that arise at the mental level will create effects in the body, in the physical body. Thus, our physical symptoms of suffering are not merely reactions to physical causes, but display their effects because of what they mean. The psyche and the soma&mdash;the mind and the body&mdash;are elements of a single system, and so it is important for healers to understand that the dimension of meaning is always involved.</p>\n<p>The manomayakosha, or the mental body, is the operating system of the physical body. It is also known as the ego, as we said, the Soy Burger, but it&#8217;s very important to understand, Shunyamurti clarifies for us that we are not born with an ego. The mental sheath is almost a <em>tabula rasa</em>, like a blank slate or a computer that has not been yet fully programmed. It contains the <em>sanskaras</em> of past lives and other mental proclivities, but there&#8217;s actually nothing written yet. The writing begins when the soul enters the uterus, and this is usually at about three or four months after conception, and then the fetus takes in impressions that will later be mentalized. The human body comes with a few instinctual drives, but mostly it has been conditioned by its early experiences. Once language has been acquired, then the ego scripts get written very early, and they can remain enforced for an entire lifetime if they&#8217;re not deleted, and the mind reprogrammed by one&#8217;s higher intelligence.</p>\n<p>Many psychotherapists would agree with all of this, but where the yogis are able to go beyond most psychologists is their understanding that the mental body, the manomayakosha, can be truly healed only by connecting it with the next higher body, the vigyanamayakosha, the wisdom body.</p>\n<p>Through this connection, an upgraded operating system can be downloaded into the mind, either gradually or all at once. And this more coherent system is known to Jungians as the &ldquo;archetypal self&rdquo;&mdash;this level of the vigyanamayakosha. This self has no traces of infantile reactivity, instead it is structured by the noble virtues resonant with the Supreme Self. The archetypal self, when activated, functions as a being of compassion and wisdom, known in Buddhism as a <em>bodhisattva</em>, a being open to the infinite, who is preparing to merge entirely into its unborn, eternal, luminous fullness, its Buddha Nature, and be liberated from the phenomenal matrix.</p>\n<p>The vigyanamayakosha contains the higher intelligence that can discern when the thoughts in the mental body are disordered and need to be corrected, as the mental body itself has many blind spots and does not understand, also, the physical organism. All the mental body has is a mental image of a body, and let&#8217;s remember that this mental image resides here in the subconscious mind; it is out of reach of this conscious aspect of our egoic mind. This is why you have to go to a medical doctor to figure out what is wrong with your body, because your mind doesn&#8217;t know. The mind only has a set of physical body images and ego constructs to work with. The wisdom body knows much more about reality, including the fact that its knowledge still belongs to the representational field, and thus is knowledge only of the cosmic illusion. It is part of maya, even though it is the part that knows that reality includes more than maya. But it can only know this symbolically until it is actually connected to the highest sheath that is not reachable by thought.</p>\n<p>This highest sheath, the <em>anandamayakosha</em>, is the one we enjoy every night, but not consciously, since it is the state of deep sleep. It is called the bliss sheath because when we are in deep sleep, beyond the reach of dreams, with no trace of an ego existing, that is when we are happy. The only time most human beings feel bliss is in deep sleep, but because we are asleep, the soul does not retain the benefit of that bliss while awake, except that it gets out of bed feeling rested and recharged. The first goal of Sat Yoga is to be able to know that bliss while awake, and then to transcend the bliss sheath to attain the ultimate Source of the bliss itself.</p>\n<p>The manomayakosha is also the central body in our diagram because it is the locus of ego-consciousness. The state of the ego governs the physical organism and is the level of consciousness in which thinking takes place. And this is the center from which we can understand and learn how to access our higher bodies and the Supreme Self. And so literally, in our Sat Yoga approach, we start here.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti teaches us, &ldquo;When used properly, the manomayakosha functions as mature conceptualizing mind. Profound concepts enable us to connect to the archetypes, and through them to point to that which lies beyond all concepts, the source of consciousness. But we must not fall into the trap of mistaking the concept for what it points to. Otherwise we will stagnate on the plane of representation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The body image is fused with other subconscious self-images, and this infiltrates the conscious mind and distorts our perception of reality. Thus, the ego lives in a narcissistic bubble that is divorced from the Real. As we learned in our last class, this egoic mental sheath, filled with delusions from primitive, subconscious infantile strata, is governed by an internal censoring agency. Thus, the conscious mind is ignorant of many things, including not only repressed memories, but even its own nature as distorted and delusional, and not in control of its own database. So the Censor, here in the center, remember, censors our higher body information, as well as what&#8217;s going on in the lower bodies, and of course, automatically censor our understanding of this through line, this Mahasutratma.</p>\n<p>Because one&#8217;s self-image is largely made up of projections of others in the past, it is taken as a given. If one&#8217;s family origin was dysfunctional, and if one&#8217;s role was victim, or scapegoat, or troublemaker, then one will usually continue to feel the way one did as a child, with such thoughts accompanying emotions such as, one does not deserve happiness, or even the right to exist, or one feels hatred toward the world, or toward God, or toward oneself, and thus one will create events of self-sabotage and destruction of relationships. One might also have been the golden child, and as an adult may continue to whitewash everything to maintain a superficial and naive veneer of harmony, when more sinister forces are actually at play.</p>\n<p>It is with the mental sheath that we must begin our inner work until we can open up access to the wisdom sheath that is unaffected by past traumas. Once the mental sheath has been disarmed, deconstructed, and cleansed of its baggage, then the deeper wisdom and love that emanates from one&#8217;s real being will function as the new locus of consciousness. And this means that the center of your life will be lived from the soul, not the ego. The way we map, that is, that literally the vigyanamayakosha, with its wholeness of heart and intellect, becomes the new center of the cross, when one is now living in the soul.</p>\n<p>When the wisdom sheath is activated, one&#8217;s creative genius is awakened at this level. There is greater capacity for compassion and innate love of nature and of God and of the infinite beauty of the Real. One perceives the perfection of all that is and understands the true significance of all the deep patterns that make up the structure of the cosmos. At this level, one no longer identifies oneself with a particular organism, but as intelligence itself&mdash;luminous, timeless, pure Awareness. However, this knowledge is still mostly on the symbolic plane at this level, and though it frees one from the lower <em>chakras</em>, the awareness must still make the leap beyond its symbolic anchor and enter the luminous Emptiness of mental stillness, which is possible only by awakening the bliss sheath.</p>\n<p>The anandamayakosha, the bliss body is attained when all intentions, desires, and fears have dropped away. Simple presence remains. There is complete intuitive knowing, but without thought. And since one&#8217;s world was a complex thought construct, the whole world illusion drops away, but still there is a sense that this boundless openness belongs to a being who remains separate from the ultimate Source, and thus whose glimpse of liberation is still temporary and conditional.</p>\n<p>Thus, even the bliss sheath must be transcended. Once in the bliss sheath, it becomes clear that all five sheaths constitute a single manifestation of a stream of information, that extends through time, and includes other incarnations, other lifetimes that we often will mark like this.</p>\n<p>The reality of the sutratma becomes palpable. In this state, one can drop all karma and enter fully into the consciousness of the soul. The sutratma is the soul&#8217;s vehicle through time. At the moment of each incarnation&mdash;this is the present one&mdash;the soul emanates another five sheaths, including a new food body. The sutratma contains all the information of all the souls past and future lives in this cycle of time. The sutratma is literally one thread in an entire cosmic tapestry of meaning&mdash;the matrix of nature, the universe as a whole.</p>\n<p>The Mahasutratma, the largest body of all, is the reflection of universal, infinite consciousness. Because a single supreme intelligence is directing the entire unfoldment of the explicit order, the revelation of the hidden source and power that underlies all will transform the creation. The white light that projects the holographic images that make up the world will shine through, unveiling its true divine essence. Every soul&#8217;s destiny affects and is affected by all the other threads in the tapestry, as all are interconnected and constitute a single intelligence, a single superorganism. All of nature is one vast ecosystem&mdash;even the galaxies and the intergalactic clusters distributed throughout the cosmos are part of one ecosystem, one ultimate body, the Mahasutratma.</p>\n<p>The function of meditation is to bring the mind into perfect resonance with the whole. Then the microcosm that is our individual self will function in conscious alignment with the Self of the macrocosm, and in the past, Shunyamurti has drawn the analogy of the idea of the entire diamond will light up, to represent this.</p>\n<p>In summation, we can think of all of this through a musical metaphor, using the concepts of harmony and melody, we can understand the vertical dimension of consciousness as the harmonic, and the sutratma as the melody that you create throughout all of your different lifetimes. And of course, for each being it will be different, but you are trying to reach your highest and most beautiful note in any given lifetime, while also creating the most beautiful melodious relationships with others, and abiding in harmony with all the bodies, and all beings, at every scale, while, as we said, your sutratma contributes its unique melody to the symphony of God&#8217;s universe.</p>\n<p>Finally, let us remember that all our seven bodies are only vehicles&mdash;realizing that the Self creates and drives the seven bodies from the universe down to your physical organism, is what is important. To know that Supreme Intelligence that is beyond all seven bodies is true fulfillment in life. We don&#8217;t want to become obsessed with any of the bodies, but simply use them as pointers to that which is never embodied, is always beyond, and yet is the source, the creative energy out of which all bodies appear.</p>\n<p>This is what we call the Supreme Self.</p>\n<p>Blessings on your journey to this highest level of your being.</p>\n<p>Namaste.</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Seven-Bodies.pdf">The Seven Bodies.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/kyen9q/Class_5_Final_Final-converted7sjnv.mp3">The Seven Bodies &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Understanding the seven bodies of consciousness can clarify the causes of suffering that inevitably manifest in your life as any symptom—from physical disease to emotional instability to obsessive thinking.

If a body is drained of its prana, its bioelectrical energy, it quickly becomes a dead corpse. Prana is the energy that actually runs the body, not food.</p><p>Manomayakosha:</p><p>The mental body; <em>mano</em> comes from <em>manas</em> (mind). This refers to the ordinary thinking mind of the ego, the operating system of the organism. The manomayakosha is the central body, the locus of ego-consciousness. This is the center from which we can understand and learn how to access our higher bodies and the Supreme Self.</p><p>"The beliefs, thoughts, drives and emotions that arise at the mental level will create effects in the physical body. Thus, our physical symptoms of suffering are not merely reactions to physical causes, but display their effects because of what they mean. The psyche and the soma, the mind and the body are elements of a single system, and so it is important for healers to understand that the dimension of meaning is always involved."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p><p>Vigyanamayakosha:</p><p>The wisdom body; <em>gyana</em> means spiritual knowledge in Sanskrit (knowledge of the Self, beyond language); <em>vigyana</em> means beyond knowledge, which is wisdom. This level of consciousness intuitively knows our true nature, the right way to live, and is able to listen to the Voice of the Heart, the voice that comes from the innermost silence.</p><p>Anandamayakosha:</p><p>The bliss body, attained when all intentions, desires, and fears have dropped away. Simple presence remains. There is complete intuitive knowing, but without thought. And since one’s world was a complex thought construct, the whole world illusion drops away. <br />But if there is a sense that this boundless openness belongs to a being who remains separate from its ultimate Source, even the bliss sheath must be transcended.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The 2 Sutras</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>In addition to the koshas, we have two other kinds of body, one that represents our consciousness through time, and the other that constitutes the consciousness that underlies all that appears in spacetime as a totality.<br /><br />The word <em>Sutratma</em> is a combination of thread and atma, which in this case, refers to the soul-consciousness, not the absolute Self.</p><p>Sutratma:</p><p>The soul’s vehicle through time; at the moment of each incarnation, the soul emanates another five sheaths, including a new food body. The sutratma contains the information flow that connects your current life to your past and future lives in this cycle of time, so that at every moment, if you focus on the right level, you have access to all information from all time.</p><p>Mahasutratma:</p><p>This is the largest body of all, the reflection of universal, infinite consciousness; the entire database of the holographic appearance of the universe is accessible if you attune to the right frequency, and such attunement enables you to receive information from the cosmic level of consciousness.</p><p>The Supreme Intelligence is beyond all seven bodies, which are only vehicles created—and driven—by the Self. We can use these vehicles as pointers to that which is never embodied, is always beyond, and yet is the Source, the creative energy out of which all bodies appear—the Supreme Self.</p>	===LESSON_END===

Welcome to class six on <em>The Kundalini Map of Sat Yoga.</em> From very ancient times, the yogis were the scientists of consciousness who endeavored to map the developmental pathways of psychological and spiritual growth. The Kundalini Map is the best known and the most useful of the maps that were developed by the yogis long ago. But the Kundalini concept has been misunderstood by many modern Hatha Yogis and Western new age believers.</p>\n<p>The Kundalini Map that we will explain is different from the pop version of the map that you may already be aware of. Its prime elements are known as <em>chakras</em>. No doubt you are familiar with the term, and we hope you will be open-minded in listening to our explanation of what a chakra really signifies. Our understanding of the nature of a chakra, in Sat Yoga, is different from the ones taught in some other schools of yoga psychology. The Kundalini Map is an important artifact that will enable you to transform yourself through recognizing where you are and where you want to go. More importantly, the Map explains the logic that is now holding you in bondage to an inferior level of identity. It enables you to understand how to change your attitudes, ideas, emotions, and behavior, to create a more fulfilling life.</p>\n<p>The Map is designed to show you the inner territory of consciousness in which you find yourself. It may be a level of identity that you have outgrown, and that you want to rise from to a higher level. In other words, this map is to be used as a tool.</p>\n<p>It is not just an interesting theory. It shows you where you&#8217;re stuck in life, why you&#8217;re stuck, and what you need to do to get unstuck. And this is probably the most important tool for self-understanding you will have encountered&mdash;but the knowledge it contains must be applied to your life. Once we have understood the logic of psychospiritual development, then we will know what we must do to free ourselves from suffering.</p>\n<p>The word <em>Kundalini</em> refers to the <em>life energy</em> that lies coiled in potentiality, at the lowest level of consciousness, and then rises, serpent-like, through the seven levels of psychospiritual development. This symbol I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen many times. This is the symbol for this coiled energy that is coiled around <em>Chakra One</em>, and as we grow moves through the chakras. The Kundalini can rise quickly or slowly, but usually it is a matter of gradual maturity and overcoming of obstacles, events of transformation, and moments of truth, in which one dies to a lower level and attains a higher and greater sense of being.</p>\n<p>The chakras are usually shown as if they&#8217;re located in the physical body, but they&#8217;re not physical. They are located in consciousness, and this is why we depict them as seven circles with no bodily location. The chakra&rsquo;s power affects your whole body. One does not really feel it in one place. Maybe you have a belief that it does pertain to a certain place in your body, and your belief will make it feel that way, but they exist in mind.</p>\n<p>In essence, they are the vibrational frequency vortexes centered in the mental sheath, the wisdom sheath, the bliss sheath, and beyond. Those terms you will recognize from our last class on the Seven Bodies. But it is true that these vortexes do have powerful effects in the physical body via the pranic body. It is also true that the chakras tend to have specific effects of stimulation of particular organs in the physical body, but they each affect, as I said already, the entire body, because they govern our overall behavior and emotional states. If we take the example of anger, you don&#8217;t become angry in one place in your body; your entire mind and body become filled with anger, for example.</p>\n<p>Each chakra is a rotating vortex of energy that creates pressure, drawing consciousness towards its core as well as radiating outward, creating an energy field extending into one&#8217;s aura. The consciousness that approaches a chakra will be allured by its power, which can activate one&#8217;s behavior toward maximal sensual intensity. And thus chakra energy causes a temporary high, and this is the cause of addictions, and the fixation to a chakra will dictate one&#8217;s way of life.</p>\n<p>If consciousness is totally swallowed by any of the <em>lower chakras</em>&mdash;and we mean the lower three chakras that constitute the ego&mdash;it can lead to things such as overdose, or other reckless and irrational behavior, which one often learns the hard way. Falling into a lower chakra can be literally catastrophic, so the strategy of a relatively functional ego that feeds off a particular chakra, is to flirt with its energy without being captured fully in its entrancing whirlpool&mdash;meaning we stay at the edges, we play at the edges of the lake of the energy of the chakra. The ego tries to find a safe distance according to its own cost/benefit algorithm, and the ego usually gradually establishes a base of operations near enough to a chakra to be able to taste its energy without being completely sucked in.</p>\n<p>Such a base located between any two chakras we call an <em>assemblage point</em>, and they are drawn on our map by these lines in between the chakras. At each assemblage point, the ego takes on different capacities, values, desires, fears, all which are organized by its balance between the two chakras it feeds from. In fact, most fully developed egos oscillate among all three assemblage points, depending on the situations they are in, and the need for specific energies to cope with them. So, for example, one may function at the third assemblage point while engaged in professional work, then drop into the second assemblage point when dealing with difficult family members, and shift into the first assemblage point when eating dinner. Then one may return to the third assemblage point to enjoy listening to classical music, or gazing at artwork, or participating in a religious ritual or prayer.</p>\n<p>But before going further, let&#8217;s examine a simplified drawing of the Chakra Map. These are the chakras and the assemblage points that we will be discussing in this class. Chakra One we call <em>unintegrated consciousness</em>. <em>Chakra Two</em> is <em>erotic fusion</em>. <em>Chakra Three</em> is known as the chakra of <em>fury</em>, or also <em>rage</em>, or <em>domination</em>. <em>Chakra Four</em> is known as the chakra of <em>divine love</em>, or <em>surrender</em>. <em>Chakra Five</em> is <em>archetypal wisdom</em>, or <em>higher intelligence</em>. <em>Chakra Six</em> is <em>command</em>&mdash;mastery over the mind, and <em>Chakra Seven</em> has several names&mdash;<em>Emptiness</em>, <em>Supreme Self</em>, <em>Liberation</em> from <em>maya</em>, or <em>Nirvana</em>.</p>\n<p>The first assemblage point between Chakra One and two, is called the <em>Clinging Point</em>. The second assemblage point, between Chakra Two and Three, is called the <em>Dispossession Point</em>. The third assemblage point that pertains to the ego, is the Disillusionment Point. The higher three assemblage points then pertain to soul-consciousness, and the fourth assemblage point, which is the first of the higher chakras, is called the <em>Discernment Point</em>. The fifth assemblage point is called the <em>Wisdom Point</em>, and the sixth assemblage point is called the <em>Dispassion Point</em>.</p>\n<p>One way that this spectrum of consciousness has been depicted is that the one radiant energy of pure consciousness, once it enters and animates the human brain, which acts like a prism, gets dispersed like a rainbow, into seven vibrational frequencies or colors, and each one becomes a separate vortex.</p>\n<p>The ego is born into unconsciousness and ignorance of its real nature. It becomes conscious gradually in fusion with the mother. When it is weaned, it feels fury and tries to dominate the other&mdash;and these are the three chakras that constitute the habitat of the ego. One rarely escapes their magnetic energy field and reaches Chakra Four. The ego&#8217;s initial project is to construct safe assemblage points from which to deal with the lower chakra energies, and much of the art of child raising concerns helping the child to accomplish this in order to adapt to the social demands of school and later adulthood.</p>\n<p>The lower three chakras emit the alluring energies of what we call the <em>Lower Death Drive</em>. We refer to it as <em>lower</em> death because, as we shall see further on, there&#8217;s also a <em>higher</em> drive towards ego death and liberation, and we depict these in this way: (LDD) Lower Death Drive, and once you get into Chakra Four, <em>Upper Death Drive</em> (UDD). But if one drops into any of these lower chakras, it can be literally lethal. In Chakra Three, one can go berserk with rage and die a violent death. Chakra Two can be the cause of sex addiction and fatal attractions that can destroy one&#8217;s life. Chakra One can lead to actual suicide, but also alcoholism, autism, psychosis, or other forms of dysfunction.</p>\n<p>The lower chakras comprise an irresistible force because they promise to take away the pain of loneliness, abandonment, and dread. The ego learns to titrate the amount of each energy it imbibes. For example, someone in the second assemblage point may watch porn instead of visiting prostitutes, or committing rape, which would be a Chakra Three enactment, but the situation can get easily out of control. Some egos decide the safest course is to settle in at the first or second assemblage point. The first one, as we said, we call the Clinging Point, in which one psychologically clings to a mother figure in a semi-erotic entanglement and remains developmentally stunted. The second assemblage point is called the Dispossession Point. Here, one steps away from complete dependency, but with anger, and envy, and a desire for revenge that&#8217;s usually taken out on others in some form of bullying, or intimidation, or an avoidant personality.</p>\n<p>Part of the existential problem for every human ego is that the lower assemblage points are relatively sane but boring, and subconsciously leave us feeling stress, anxiety, and other negative emotions. The assemblage point thus stabilizes you in a state that is not really stable, and this is the fragility of the ego. It can be easily destabilized and lose its equilibrium and fall into one of the two chakras that it is resonating between. We also feel called by the sirens of the lower chakras because each offer a fantasy of satisfaction, but each is a form of madness. The higher chakras also bring madness, but it&#8217;s divine madness, the divine madness of joy and wisdom, and the pure light. But the lower chakra madness breeds crime, violence, promiscuity, and suicidal drug overdoses, as well as the neurotic types of dysfunction that operate at the lower assemblage points, such as obsession with food, shopping, addictions, money, hoarding, gambling, and vanity.</p>\n<p>On a collective level, they bring war, oppression, sadomasochistic social structures, and pathological cultures. Most people today are still anchored in Chakra One throughout their whole lives. They are drawn toward the annihilation of consciousness, toward the fantasy of returning to the womb. They do not want to have to deal with the difficulties of mature existence, and they want perfect freedom that comes from spacing out, playing video games, drinking alcohol, and living dependently. They do not want to have to think rigorously or solve problems&mdash;they want a quick fix, a no-brainer, an easy way out, and they want to pretend that they are masters, but they are actually living as slaves.</p>\n<p>When a baby first emerges from the womb, it clings to the mother&#8217;s breast. This first place that you assemble yourself psychologically relates to this moment&mdash;clinging to the mother and not yet a fully separate being. There is still an implicit belief that &ldquo;I and the mother are one.&rdquo; The baby&#8217;s terror of abandonment is too unbearable to feel, so separation is denied as long as possible. It is important for the infant&#8217;s future psychological health that the awareness of separation from the mother may not be forced prematurely, and this is why in most cultures, every time the baby cries, the mother comes quickly to pick it up. And this equates in the infant&#8217;s mind to: &ldquo;Mommy is a part of me. When I cry, she appears.&rdquo; Later the fantasy gets modified into, &ldquo;Mommy is my slave,&rdquo; and then later, once it has undergone weaning and separation, in the second assemblage point, &ldquo;I hate Mommy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adults stuck at the first assemblage point will be needy and dependent, with separation anxiety, and lacking self-confidence. And those in the second assemblage point will be angry, rebellious, and passive aggressive. They will also often be tempted irresistibly by Chakra Two. The second chakra is initially stimulated by the mother&#8217;s touch. She bathes, tickles, and kisses the infant. She also might sing to it, and of course, she feeds it. She is the perfect love object, and this is the beginning of what Freud called the <em>Oedipus Complex,</em> which is essentially attachment to Chakra Two. Once the phase of symbiosis ends, and the child must feed itself, get toilet trained, share Mommy with Daddy, and siblings, sleep alone&mdash;the ego is cast out of its paradise and lands in the second assemblage point, dispossessed of the mother, and is not happy about it.</p>\n<p>Chakra Three offers angry energy and fantasies of dominance and revenge, conquest of the lost object, and leads to temper tantrums and other forms of acting out. At best, it will be used in adolescence to get the best grades, or be the best at football, or to make as much money as possible. Life will become about getting ahead, but not about going inside one&#8217;s head and heart to find the Real Self.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s important to understand that the traditional role of the father was to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the child&#8217;s attempts to regress, to return to the breast of the mother. His function was to lay down the law, and the law of the father was the structuring power that enabled the child to sublimate its desires, to delay gratification, to accept life on its own terms, and to be at peace internally with life and death. The father was to orient the child towards culture and higher values. The biological father was to be the representative of God the Father, and he installed the <em>name of the father</em> in the child&#8217;s psyche, meaning an acceptance of higher order, responsibility, loyalty to the <em>Dharma</em>, to God&#8217;s Commandments, to truth, to logos, logic, mutuality, equality, compassion, and intersubjectivity, rather than treating others as objects, and treating fantasies as reality.</p>\n<p>For the child to make the passage from the first assemblage point to the second in a healthy way, it needs to feel unconditionally loved by both the mother and father, even though they refuse to satisfy all the child&#8217;s demands. To pass to the third assemblage point, the child must feel the mother&#8217;s acceptance of the father&#8217;s authority, and of the ideals the father&#8217;s promoting and, in best of cases, embodying. To be free from the misuse of our life energies&mdash;which we would translate as staying in the lower chakras&mdash;one must rise at least to the third assemblage point, and then create a strategy to go higher still, motivated by the ideals assimilated from the parents.</p>\n<p>So we must extricate ourselves from the <em>dispossession point</em>, and reach disillusionment. Psychological adulthood begins in the third assemblage point; we refer to it as the <em>disillusionment point</em>. This is because the ego finally becomes depressed by its own failure to grow up, and disgusted with its immature behavior. It becomes disillusioned with its childish fantasies, and decides to become a productive, responsible, and mature member of society. For most modern schools of psychology, the disillusionment point is the end of the line. This level of consciousness is yoked to social norms, and at this disillusionment point one leads the rather strait-laced life of a well-adapted adult. One gets a formal education, builds a career, raises a family, but never really comes alive, never discovers who they are. They follow the rules, they get praise in a house in the suburbs&mdash;at least that used to be the case&mdash;but they fail to realize their full potential, nor gain full psychological self-understanding.</p>\n<p>But many such adults realize at some point&mdash;for some, it will happen during the so-called &ldquo;midlife crisis&rdquo;&mdash;that they want more from life, and they can use the energies of Chakra Three positively, not aggressively, to assert their right to live a divine life, and follow their heart, to chart a course of their own, without needing the approval of others. And there are three main strategies, or sublimation channels, that those in this assemblage point tend to choose to open up access to higher levels of their being.</p>\n<p>The first is the <em>aesthetic</em> path. Some will become artists, or lovers of art, music, dance, drama, cinema, or literature, and this will focus will awaken sensitivity to the higher and deeper reaches of human nature. One&#8217;s creative intelligence will be activated, one&#8217;s appreciation for beauty, and one may start to download amazing new ideas and inspirations. Some will be called to travel, to visit distant lands, exotic cultures, to learn the history and achievements of other peoples, and other times. Some will be called to study science, to understand the beauty of the structure of the natural world, and even of the human mind itself. Some will study the culinary arts, becoming a chef, or a mistress of spices, or a gourmet of high cuisine. And still others may engage in other aesthetic practices, like flower arranging, gardening, dress designing, or deeper engagement with the natural world, with such activities as astronomical observation, and birdwatching, and diving, kayaking, even what some would call extreme sports. Sometimes these activities trigger regressions to the second, or even the first assemblage point, especially if sexuality, violence, or danger, that is only partially sublimated, is involved.</p>\n<p>The next sublimation channel is the <em>ethical</em> path, and in this approach to inner growth one chooses to follow discipline, to live a morally upright life, and even to study such subjects as law, rhetoric, philosophy of ethics, and organizational processes. And one may decide to become a leader oneself.</p>\n<p>The third sublimation channel is the <em>religious</em> path. One may be drawn to study theology, to attend rituals, to engage in prayer, meditation, charitable service, or go on a pilgrimage. One may also study mysticism, the lives of saints, or even to meet and learn from living sages.</p>\n<p>Any of these three channels may lead one toward growth to the next assemblage point, the <em>discernment point</em>, between Chakra Four and Five. Here one becomes able to think clearly, critically, and wisely, and to feel compassion, and a desire to serve the world in the most effective ways possible.</p>\n<p>Chakra Four is the turning point for an individual consciousness. To enter into Chakra Four is the major rite of passage. One must sacrifice everything one has gained as an ego and open one&#8217;s heart to whatever God Wills. If one gets to the center of this chakra, one returns as a being of divine love; one now lives as an awakened soul, no longer as an ego.</p>\n<p>From the discernment point, where the <em>buddhi</em> opens up, it is an easy leap into Chakra Five, in which one&#8217;s inner knowing, one&#8217;s higher intelligence, becomes fully activated. At this level, one downloads new paradigms of reality, new paths of inner development, the deeper nuances of understanding oneself and others, and reality as a whole. One enters a level of soul-consciousness in which one understands what it means to be a true <em>Gnostic</em>, a knower of the Real. Yet in Chakra Five this knowledge is still symbolic&mdash;one understands intellectually, but one has not yet tasted the full power of infinite consciousness.</p>\n<p>At this point, one establishes one&#8217;s attention at the assemblage point between Chakras Five and Six, called the <em>wisdom point</em>. One&#8217;s meditations become ever deeper and more silent&mdash;at some moment one enters then Chakra Six in a state that the yogis of India call <em>Samadhi</em>. The Zen Yogis call it <em>Satori</em>, or <em>Kensho</em>. The mind stops and the Self is realized, power is received, and one attains mastery over the movement of the mind. This enables the attainment of the highest assemblage point, the <em>dispassion point</em>. Here one is poised between Chakra Six and Chakra Seven.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;One no longer identifies with the body, nor even with thought. The world is recognized as a dream, a projection, a magical display of infinite meaningfulness. One has no interest in any worldly entanglements, one wants only to attain union with the ultimate intelligence that is dreaming this world. One yearns for the Supreme Liberation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Chakra Seven that goal is attained. In yogic terms this is called <em>Jivan Mukti</em>, or liberation in life. It is nothing less than God-consciousness. We will speak more about liberation in future classes, but for now what will be most helpful is to understand in which assemblage points you resonate or oscillate between. The assemblage points are like rungs of a ladder. In fact, in the Bible they are referred to as <em>Jacob&#8217;s Ladder</em> or the <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>. That&#8217;s another way that we can look at this, is literally a ladder to heaven. The <em>Kabbalah </em>refers to them as <em>Sephirot</em>. Every tradition has its own names for these graduated levels of consciousness. Moving up the ladder is the work of Sat Yoga, it is a kind of alchemy, or inner transformation. Each step upward is a kind of death and rebirth, until we reach total transcendence.</p>\n<p>Postmodern Western culture has largely denied or forgotten about the <em>higher chakras</em>. They were known by the Greek philosophers, like Heraclitus, and Plato, and the Neoplatonic lineage, for whom attaining the highest level, the One, or the Good, was the goal of life. And of course, liberation, and God-consciousness, is the aim of all religions. The problem is that in the modern secular age, the attainment of God-realization is often not taken seriously, even by religious people. Freud famously called religion an infantile illusion, and Marx called it &ldquo;the opium of the people&rdquo;<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Today, the primary social ideology promotes competition and dominance (Chakra Three). It identifies people with their physical bodies, and valorizes the amassing of financial wealth (Chakra One)&mdash;and promotes sex as the ultimate enjoyment (Chakra Two). Surreptitiously, it encourages the use of alcohol to lower sexual inhibitions, and anesthetizes psychological pain. Drug use is also promoted, especially by doctors, but also on the black market, for a variety of uses: to pacify people, to increase productivity, to mask anxiety, to cope with depression, and to block other symptoms of internal disorder. Even those who use psychedelic substances&mdash;now known as <em>entheogens</em>&mdash;to have spiritual openings only get delusory glimpses of ego death and become dependent on the chemicals to get high.</p>\n<p>Today, we tend to settle for Hollywood versions of higher reality, or the hero&#8217;s journey. We live vicariously. Most choose safety and economic security over spiritual high adventure. Today&#8217;s ideology is materialist, atheist, and nihilist. We have all grown up in such a culture of narcissism and egocentricity, that very few escape the lower chakras, or even desire to do so.</p>\n<p>The religious institutions have lost their legitimacy, and the ego is afraid of solitude. Those who do make the attempt to realize Ultimate Reality generally find the path hard going because there isn&#8217;t an integrated path available for most people. The Eastern meditative paths do not take account of modern ego defenses, while the modern approaches, such as psychoanalysis, leave you stranded at the disillusionment point. In recent years, there has been an even more steep fall in social coherence&mdash;the education system in the West has been dumbed down, computers have replaced books, images have superseded texts, and commercialism has destroyed the integrity of the arts. Corporate control has even taken over and degraded the universities. Wisdom is all but extinct, and divine love is on the endangered list.</p>\n<p>Cynicism is the most popular attitude valorized for the ego. Postmodern philosophy spread the belief that any so-called &ldquo;grand narrative&rdquo; about reality is a fiction, thus any expression of truth is considered relative, subjective, partial. No one, they insist, can escape the conditioned state, the trap of false beliefs, or the urges of the lower chakras. Indeed, there are few role models of those who have authentically attained the status of saint, sage, or enlightened being. This is because it takes great courage to break the mold of the ego, and to live humbly, with the desire to learn and grow, to discover one&#8217;s highest potentialities, and to transcend the ego and its comfort zone. But only by entering into the unknown levels of trans-egoic consciousness can one know true freedom, empowerment, and limitless joy.</p>\n<p>The chakras can be configured as a triangular matrix known as the Mountain of God. Here, we can see that the two slopes reflect each other: Chakra One relates to Chakra Seven. One is about nonexistence in the womb, and Seven is transcendence of individual existence into the womb of the universe, into the bliss of the eternal, uncreated Self. Chakra Two is about human desire, while Chakra Six is the desire of God. Chakra Three is dominance of others, while Chakra Five is about dominance over one&#8217;s own ego through wisdom. And at the peak of the mountain is Chakra Four: love itself. Love as God.</p>\n<p>So I want to go back to this spiral that I put on the board at the beginning of the class, to show you the turns of the Kundalini. We tend to go through the chakras following this path: from Chakra Four, the power of love, we conquer the will. And we use that energy, that power, and raise the will to Chakra Five, to wisdom, which becomes the will to surrender to God, but is also our attainment of self-mastery over the ego.</p>\n<p>Using that wisdom, we conquer the lustful sex drive, in Chakra Two, and raise it through desire for union with God, to Chakra Six. And then we take that power of mastery, and use it to raise the chaotic energy of Chakra One, and bring that energy to the Absolute Beyond of Chakra Seven. Our spiritual journey is then complete.</p>\n<p>And these turns of the Kundalini are essentially what is being symbolized by this very ancient and now rather commonly seen symbol of the spiral. In the final state, all the chakras become a unified field once more. The world is not separate from God. All is light. All is the intelligence of God in divine play. All is bliss, and one can live in the world joyously, but one is not of the world. The Real Self is the dreamer of the most beautiful dream that could be imagined. One is awake, imperceptible, and free, and that is the goal.</p>\n<p>Namaste</p>\n<p>Namaste. Welcome to class six on <em>The Kundalini Map of Sat Yoga.</em> From very ancient times, the yogis were the scientists of consciousness who endeavored to map the developmental pathways of psychological and spiritual growth. The Kundalini Map is the best known and the most useful of the maps that were developed by the yogis long ago. But the Kundalini concept has been misunderstood by many modern Hatha Yogis and Western new age believers.</p>\n<p>The Kundalini Map that we will explain is different from the pop version of the map that you may already be aware of. Its prime elements are known as <em>chakras</em>. No doubt you are familiar with the term, and we hope you will be open-minded in listening to our explanation of what a chakra really signifies. Our understanding of the nature of a chakra, in Sat Yoga, is different from the ones taught in some other schools of yoga psychology. The Kundalini Map is an important artifact that will enable you to transform yourself through recognizing where you are and where you want to go. More importantly, the Map explains the logic that is now holding you in bondage to an inferior level of identity. It enables you to understand how to change your attitudes, ideas, emotions, and behavior, to create a more fulfilling life.</p>\n<p>The Map is designed to show you the inner territory of consciousness in which you find yourself. It may be a level of identity that you have outgrown, and that you want to rise from to a higher level. In other words, this map is to be used as a tool.</p>\n<p>It is not just an interesting theory. It shows you where you&#8217;re stuck in life, why you&#8217;re stuck, and what you need to do to get unstuck. And this is probably the most important tool for self-understanding you will have encountered&mdash;but the knowledge it contains must be applied to your life. Once we have understood the logic of psychospiritual development, then we will know what we must do to free ourselves from suffering.</p>\n<p>The word <em>Kundalini</em> refers to the <em>life energy</em> that lies coiled in potentiality, at the lowest level of consciousness, and then rises, serpent-like, through the seven levels of psychospiritual development. This symbol I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen many times. This is the symbol for this coiled energy that is coiled around <em>Chakra One</em>, and as we grow moves through the chakras. The Kundalini can rise quickly or slowly, but usually it is a matter of gradual maturity and overcoming of obstacles, events of transformation, and moments of truth, in which one dies to a lower level and attains a higher and greater sense of being.</p>\n<p>The chakras are usually shown as if they&#8217;re located in the physical body, but they&#8217;re not physical. They are located in consciousness, and this is why we depict them as seven circles with no bodily location. The chakra&rsquo;s power affects your whole body. One does not really feel it in one place. Maybe you have a belief that it does pertain to a certain place in your body, and your belief will make it feel that way, but they exist in mind.</p>\n<p>In essence, they are the vibrational frequency vortexes centered in the mental sheath, the wisdom sheath, the bliss sheath, and beyond. Those terms you will recognize from our last class on the Seven Bodies. But it is true that these vortexes do have powerful effects in the physical body via the pranic body. It is also true that the chakras tend to have specific effects of stimulation of particular organs in the physical body, but they each affect, as I said already, the entire body, because they govern our overall behavior and emotional states. If we take the example of anger, you don&#8217;t become angry in one place in your body; your entire mind and body become filled with anger, for example.</p>\n<p>Each chakra is a rotating vortex of energy that creates pressure, drawing consciousness towards its core as well as radiating outward, creating an energy field extending into one&#8217;s aura. The consciousness that approaches a chakra will be allured by its power, which can activate one&#8217;s behavior toward maximal sensual intensity. And thus chakra energy causes a temporary high, and this is the cause of addictions, and the fixation to a chakra will dictate one&#8217;s way of life.</p>\n<p>If consciousness is totally swallowed by any of the <em>lower chakras</em>&mdash;and we mean the lower three chakras that constitute the ego&mdash;it can lead to things such as overdose, or other reckless and irrational behavior, which one often learns the hard way. Falling into a lower chakra can be literally catastrophic, so the strategy of a relatively functional ego that feeds off a particular chakra, is to flirt with its energy without being captured fully in its entrancing whirlpool&mdash;meaning we stay at the edges, we play at the edges of the lake of the energy of the chakra. The ego tries to find a safe distance according to its own cost/benefit algorithm, and the ego usually gradually establishes a base of operations near enough to a chakra to be able to taste its energy without being completely sucked in.</p>\n<p>Such a base located between any two chakras we call an <em>assemblage point</em>, and they are drawn on our map by these lines in between the chakras. At each assemblage point, the ego takes on different capacities, values, desires, fears, all which are organized by its balance between the two chakras it feeds from. In fact, most fully developed egos oscillate among all three assemblage points, depending on the situations they are in, and the need for specific energies to cope with them. So, for example, one may function at the third assemblage point while engaged in professional work, then drop into the second assemblage point when dealing with difficult family members, and shift into the first assemblage point when eating dinner. Then one may return to the third assemblage point to enjoy listening to classical music, or gazing at artwork, or participating in a religious ritual or prayer.</p>\n<p>But before going further, let&#8217;s examine a simplified drawing of the Chakra Map. These are the chakras and the assemblage points that we will be discussing in this class. Chakra One we call <em>unintegrated consciousness</em>. <em>Chakra Two</em> is <em>erotic fusion</em>. <em>Chakra Three</em> is known as the chakra of <em>fury</em>, or also <em>rage</em>, or <em>domination</em>. <em>Chakra Four</em> is known as the chakra of <em>divine love</em>, or <em>surrender</em>. <em>Chakra Five</em> is <em>archetypal wisdom</em>, or <em>higher intelligence</em>. <em>Chakra Six</em> is <em>command</em>&mdash;mastery over the mind, and <em>Chakra Seven</em> has several names&mdash;<em>Emptiness</em>, <em>Supreme Self</em>, <em>Liberation</em> from <em>maya</em>, or <em>Nirvana</em>.</p>\n<p>The first assemblage point between Chakra One and two, is called the <em>Clinging Point</em>. The second assemblage point, between Chakra Two and Three, is called the <em>Dispossession Point</em>. The third assemblage point that pertains to the ego, is the Disillusionment Point. The higher three assemblage points then pertain to soul-consciousness, and the fourth assemblage point, which is the first of the higher chakras, is called the <em>Discernment Point</em>. The fifth assemblage point is called the <em>Wisdom Point</em>, and the sixth assemblage point is called the <em>Dispassion Point</em>.</p>\n<p>One way that this spectrum of consciousness has been depicted is that the one radiant energy of pure consciousness, once it enters and animates the human brain, which acts like a prism, gets dispersed like a rainbow, into seven vibrational frequencies or colors, and each one becomes a separate vortex.</p>\n<p>The ego is born into unconsciousness and ignorance of its real nature. It becomes conscious gradually in fusion with the mother. When it is weaned, it feels fury and tries to dominate the other&mdash;and these are the three chakras that constitute the habitat of the ego. One rarely escapes their magnetic energy field and reaches Chakra Four. The ego&#8217;s initial project is to construct safe assemblage points from which to deal with the lower chakra energies, and much of the art of child raising concerns helping the child to accomplish this in order to adapt to the social demands of school and later adulthood.</p>\n<p>The lower three chakras emit the alluring energies of what we call the <em>Lower Death Drive</em>. We refer to it as <em>lower</em> death because, as we shall see further on, there&#8217;s also a <em>higher</em> drive towards ego death and liberation, and we depict these in this way: (LDD) Lower Death Drive, and once you get into Chakra Four, <em>Upper Death Drive</em> (UDD). But if one drops into any of these lower chakras, it can be literally lethal. In Chakra Three, one can go berserk with rage and die a violent death. Chakra Two can be the cause of sex addiction and fatal attractions that can destroy one&#8217;s life. Chakra One can lead to actual suicide, but also alcoholism, autism, psychosis, or other forms of dysfunction.</p>\n<p>The lower chakras comprise an irresistible force because they promise to take away the pain of loneliness, abandonment, and dread. The ego learns to titrate the amount of each energy it imbibes. For example, someone in the second assemblage point may watch porn instead of visiting prostitutes, or committing rape, which would be a Chakra Three enactment, but the situation can get easily out of control. Some egos decide the safest course is to settle in at the first or second assemblage point. The first one, as we said, we call the Clinging Point, in which one psychologically clings to a mother figure in a semi-erotic entanglement and remains developmentally stunted. The second assemblage point is called the Dispossession Point. Here, one steps away from complete dependency, but with anger, and envy, and a desire for revenge that&#8217;s usually taken out on others in some form of bullying, or intimidation, or an avoidant personality.</p>\n<p>Part of the existential problem for every human ego is that the lower assemblage points are relatively sane but boring, and subconsciously leave us feeling stress, anxiety, and other negative emotions. The assemblage point thus stabilizes you in a state that is not really stable, and this is the fragility of the ego. It can be easily destabilized and lose its equilibrium and fall into one of the two chakras that it is resonating between. We also feel called by the sirens of the lower chakras because each offer a fantasy of satisfaction, but each is a form of madness. The higher chakras also bring madness, but it&#8217;s divine madness, the divine madness of joy and wisdom, and the pure light. But the lower chakra madness breeds crime, violence, promiscuity, and suicidal drug overdoses, as well as the neurotic types of dysfunction that operate at the lower assemblage points, such as obsession with food, shopping, addictions, money, hoarding, gambling, and vanity.</p>\n<p>On a collective level, they bring war, oppression, sadomasochistic social structures, and pathological cultures. Most people today are still anchored in Chakra One throughout their whole lives. They are drawn toward the annihilation of consciousness, toward the fantasy of returning to the womb. They do not want to have to deal with the difficulties of mature existence, and they want perfect freedom that comes from spacing out, playing video games, drinking alcohol, and living dependently. They do not want to have to think rigorously or solve problems&mdash;they want a quick fix, a no-brainer, an easy way out, and they want to pretend that they are masters, but they are actually living as slaves.</p>\n<p>When a baby first emerges from the womb, it clings to the mother&#8217;s breast. This first place that you assemble yourself psychologically relates to this moment&mdash;clinging to the mother and not yet a fully separate being. There is still an implicit belief that &ldquo;I and the mother are one.&rdquo; The baby&#8217;s terror of abandonment is too unbearable to feel, so separation is denied as long as possible. It is important for the infant&#8217;s future psychological health that the awareness of separation from the mother may not be forced prematurely, and this is why in most cultures, every time the baby cries, the mother comes quickly to pick it up. And this equates in the infant&#8217;s mind to: &ldquo;Mommy is a part of me. When I cry, she appears.&rdquo; Later the fantasy gets modified into, &ldquo;Mommy is my slave,&rdquo; and then later, once it has undergone weaning and separation, in the second assemblage point, &ldquo;I hate Mommy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adults stuck at the first assemblage point will be needy and dependent, with separation anxiety, and lacking self-confidence. And those in the second assemblage point will be angry, rebellious, and passive aggressive. They will also often be tempted irresistibly by Chakra Two. The second chakra is initially stimulated by the mother&#8217;s touch. She bathes, tickles, and kisses the infant. She also might sing to it, and of course, she feeds it. She is the perfect love object, and this is the beginning of what Freud called the <em>Oedipus Complex,</em> which is essentially attachment to Chakra Two. Once the phase of symbiosis ends, and the child must feed itself, get toilet trained, share Mommy with Daddy, and siblings, sleep alone&mdash;the ego is cast out of its paradise and lands in the second assemblage point, dispossessed of the mother, and is not happy about it.</p>\n<p>Chakra Three offers angry energy and fantasies of dominance and revenge, conquest of the lost object, and leads to temper tantrums and other forms of acting out. At best, it will be used in adolescence to get the best grades, or be the best at football, or to make as much money as possible. Life will become about getting ahead, but not about going inside one&#8217;s head and heart to find the Real Self.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s important to understand that the traditional role of the father was to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the child&#8217;s attempts to regress, to return to the breast of the mother. His function was to lay down the law, and the law of the father was the structuring power that enabled the child to sublimate its desires, to delay gratification, to accept life on its own terms, and to be at peace internally with life and death. The father was to orient the child towards culture and higher values. The biological father was to be the representative of God the Father, and he installed the <em>name of the father</em> in the child&#8217;s psyche, meaning an acceptance of higher order, responsibility, loyalty to the <em>Dharma</em>, to God&#8217;s Commandments, to truth, to logos, logic, mutuality, equality, compassion, and intersubjectivity, rather than treating others as objects, and treating fantasies as reality.</p>\n<p>For the child to make the passage from the first assemblage point to the second in a healthy way, it needs to feel unconditionally loved by both the mother and father, even though they refuse to satisfy all the child&#8217;s demands. To pass to the third assemblage point, the child must feel the mother&#8217;s acceptance of the father&#8217;s authority, and of the ideals the father&#8217;s promoting and, in best of cases, embodying. To be free from the misuse of our life energies&mdash;which we would translate as staying in the lower chakras&mdash;one must rise at least to the third assemblage point, and then create a strategy to go higher still, motivated by the ideals assimilated from the parents.</p>\n<p>So we must extricate ourselves from the <em>dispossession point</em>, and reach disillusionment. Psychological adulthood begins in the third assemblage point; we refer to it as the <em>disillusionment point</em>. This is because the ego finally becomes depressed by its own failure to grow up, and disgusted with its immature behavior. It becomes disillusioned with its childish fantasies, and decides to become a productive, responsible, and mature member of society. For most modern schools of psychology, the disillusionment point is the end of the line. This level of consciousness is yoked to social norms, and at this disillusionment point one leads the rather strait-laced life of a well-adapted adult. One gets a formal education, builds a career, raises a family, but never really comes alive, never discovers who they are. They follow the rules, they get praise in a house in the suburbs&mdash;at least that used to be the case&mdash;but they fail to realize their full potential, nor gain full psychological self-understanding.</p>\n<p>But many such adults realize at some point&mdash;for some, it will happen during the so-called &ldquo;midlife crisis&rdquo;&mdash;that they want more from life, and they can use the energies of Chakra Three positively, not aggressively, to assert their right to live a divine life, and follow their heart, to chart a course of their own, without needing the approval of others. And there are three main strategies, or sublimation channels, that those in this assemblage point tend to choose to open up access to higher levels of their being.</p>\n<p>The first is the <em>aesthetic</em> path. Some will become artists, or lovers of art, music, dance, drama, cinema, or literature, and this will focus will awaken sensitivity to the higher and deeper reaches of human nature. One&#8217;s creative intelligence will be activated, one&#8217;s appreciation for beauty, and one may start to download amazing new ideas and inspirations. Some will be called to travel, to visit distant lands, exotic cultures, to learn the history and achievements of other peoples, and other times. Some will be called to study science, to understand the beauty of the structure of the natural world, and even of the human mind itself. Some will study the culinary arts, becoming a chef, or a mistress of spices, or a gourmet of high cuisine. And still others may engage in other aesthetic practices, like flower arranging, gardening, dress designing, or deeper engagement with the natural world, with such activities as astronomical observation, and birdwatching, and diving, kayaking, even what some would call extreme sports. Sometimes these activities trigger regressions to the second, or even the first assemblage point, especially if sexuality, violence, or danger, that is only partially sublimated, is involved.</p>\n<p>The next sublimation channel is the <em>ethical</em> path, and in this approach to inner growth one chooses to follow discipline, to live a morally upright life, and even to study such subjects as law, rhetoric, philosophy of ethics, and organizational processes. And one may decide to become a leader oneself.</p>\n<p>The third sublimation channel is the <em>religious</em> path. One may be drawn to study theology, to attend rituals, to engage in prayer, meditation, charitable service, or go on a pilgrimage. One may also study mysticism, the lives of saints, or even to meet and learn from living sages.</p>\n<p>Any of these three channels may lead one toward growth to the next assemblage point, the <em>discernment point</em>, between Chakra Four and Five. Here one becomes able to think clearly, critically, and wisely, and to feel compassion, and a desire to serve the world in the most effective ways possible.</p>\n<p>Chakra Four is the turning point for an individual consciousness. To enter into Chakra Four is the major rite of passage. One must sacrifice everything one has gained as an ego and open one&#8217;s heart to whatever God Wills. If one gets to the center of this chakra, one returns as a being of divine love; one now lives as an awakened soul, no longer as an ego.</p>\n<p>From the discernment point, where the <em>buddhi</em> opens up, it is an easy leap into Chakra Five, in which one&#8217;s inner knowing, one&#8217;s higher intelligence, becomes fully activated. At this level, one downloads new paradigms of reality, new paths of inner development, the deeper nuances of understanding oneself and others, and reality as a whole. One enters a level of soul-consciousness in which one understands what it means to be a true <em>Gnostic</em>, a knower of the Real. Yet in Chakra Five this knowledge is still symbolic&mdash;one understands intellectually, but one has not yet tasted the full power of infinite consciousness.</p>\n<p>At this point, one establishes one&#8217;s attention at the assemblage point between Chakras Five and Six, called the <em>wisdom point</em>. One&#8217;s meditations become ever deeper and more silent&mdash;at some moment one enters then Chakra Six in a state that the yogis of India call <em>Samadhi</em>. The Zen Yogis call it <em>Satori</em>, or <em>Kensho</em>. The mind stops and the Self is realized, power is received, and one attains mastery over the movement of the mind. This enables the attainment of the highest assemblage point, the <em>dispassion point</em>. Here one is poised between Chakra Six and Chakra Seven.</p>\n<p>Shunyamurti says, &ldquo;One no longer identifies with the body, nor even with thought. The world is recognized as a dream, a projection, a magical display of infinite meaningfulness. One has no interest in any worldly entanglements, one wants only to attain union with the ultimate intelligence that is dreaming this world. One yearns for the Supreme Liberation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Chakra Seven that goal is attained. In yogic terms this is called <em>Jivan Mukti</em>, or liberation in life. It is nothing less than God-consciousness. We will speak more about liberation in future classes, but for now what will be most helpful is to understand in which assemblage points you resonate or oscillate between. The assemblage points are like rungs of a ladder. In fact, in the Bible they are referred to as <em>Jacob&#8217;s Ladder</em> or the <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>. That&#8217;s another way that we can look at this, is literally a ladder to heaven. The <em>Kabbalah </em>refers to them as <em>Sephirot</em>. Every tradition has its own names for these graduated levels of consciousness. Moving up the ladder is the work of Sat Yoga, it is a kind of alchemy, or inner transformation. Each step upward is a kind of death and rebirth, until we reach total transcendence.</p>\n<p>Postmodern Western culture has largely denied or forgotten about the <em>higher chakras</em>. They were known by the Greek philosophers, like Heraclitus, and Plato, and the Neoplatonic lineage, for whom attaining the highest level, the One, or the Good, was the goal of life. And of course, liberation, and God-consciousness, is the aim of all religions. The problem is that in the modern secular age, the attainment of God-realization is often not taken seriously, even by religious people. Freud famously called religion an infantile illusion, and Marx called it &ldquo;the opium of the people&rdquo;<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Today, the primary social ideology promotes competition and dominance (Chakra Three). It identifies people with their physical bodies, and valorizes the amassing of financial wealth (Chakra One)&mdash;and promotes sex as the ultimate enjoyment (Chakra Two). Surreptitiously, it encourages the use of alcohol to lower sexual inhibitions, and anesthetizes psychological pain. Drug use is also promoted, especially by doctors, but also on the black market, for a variety of uses: to pacify people, to increase productivity, to mask anxiety, to cope with depression, and to block other symptoms of internal disorder. Even those who use psychedelic substances&mdash;now known as <em>entheogens</em>&mdash;to have spiritual openings only get delusory glimpses of ego death and become dependent on the chemicals to get high.</p>\n<p>Today, we tend to settle for Hollywood versions of higher reality, or the hero&#8217;s journey. We live vicariously. Most choose safety and economic security over spiritual high adventure. Today&#8217;s ideology is materialist, atheist, and nihilist. We have all grown up in such a culture of narcissism and egocentricity, that very few escape the lower chakras, or even desire to do so.</p>\n<p>The religious institutions have lost their legitimacy, and the ego is afraid of solitude. Those who do make the attempt to realize Ultimate Reality generally find the path hard going because there isn&#8217;t an integrated path available for most people. The Eastern meditative paths do not take account of modern ego defenses, while the modern approaches, such as psychoanalysis, leave you stranded at the disillusionment point. In recent years, there has been an even more steep fall in social coherence&mdash;the education system in the West has been dumbed down, computers have replaced books, images have superseded texts, and commercialism has destroyed the integrity of the arts. Corporate control has even taken over and degraded the universities. Wisdom is all but extinct, and divine love is on the endangered list.</p>\n<p>Cynicism is the most popular attitude valorized for the ego. Postmodern philosophy spread the belief that any so-called &ldquo;grand narrative&rdquo; about reality is a fiction, thus any expression of truth is considered relative, subjective, partial. No one, they insist, can escape the conditioned state, the trap of false beliefs, or the urges of the lower chakras. Indeed, there are few role models of those who have authentically attained the status of saint, sage, or enlightened being. This is because it takes great courage to break the mold of the ego, and to live humbly, with the desire to learn and grow, to discover one&#8217;s highest potentialities, and to transcend the ego and its comfort zone. But only by entering into the unknown levels of trans-egoic consciousness can one know true freedom, empowerment, and limitless joy.</p>\n<p>The chakras can be configured as a triangular matrix known as the Mountain of God. Here, we can see that the two slopes reflect each other: Chakra One relates to Chakra Seven. One is about nonexistence in the womb, and Seven is transcendence of individual existence into the womb of the universe, into the bliss of the eternal, uncreated Self. Chakra Two is about human desire, while Chakra Six is the desire of God. Chakra Three is dominance of others, while Chakra Five is about dominance over one&#8217;s own ego through wisdom. And at the peak of the mountain is Chakra Four: love itself. Love as God.</p>\n<p>So I want to go back to this spiral that I put on the board at the beginning of the class, to show you the turns of the Kundalini. We tend to go through the chakras following this path: from Chakra Four, the power of love, we conquer the will. And we use that energy, that power, and raise the will to Chakra Five, to wisdom, which becomes the will to surrender to God, but is also our attainment of self-mastery over the ego.</p>\n<p>Using that wisdom, we conquer the lustful sex drive, in Chakra Two, and raise it through desire for union with God, to Chakra Six. And then we take that power of mastery, and use it to raise the chaotic energy of Chakra One, and bring that energy to the Absolute Beyond of Chakra Seven. Our spiritual journey is then complete.</p>\n<p>And these turns of the Kundalini are essentially what is being symbolized by this very ancient and now rather commonly seen symbol of the spiral. In the final state, all the chakras become a unified field once more. The world is not separate from God. All is light. All is the intelligence of God in divine play. All is bliss, and one can live in the world joyously, but one is not of the world. The Real Self is the dreamer of the most beautiful dream that could be imagined. One is awake, imperceptible, and free, and that is the goal.</p>\n<p>Namaste</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/Sat-Yogas-Kundalini-Map.pdf">Sat Yoga&#8217;s Kundalini Map.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/hrzm43/Class_6_Final_Final-converted6mxq6.mp3">Sat Yoga&#8217;s Kundalini Map &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>A revolutionary and radical re-conceptualization of this most ancient psycho-spiritual technology.

But the knowledge it contains must be applied in your life.</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Seven Chakras</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The <strong>chakras</strong> are vibrational frequency vortexes centered in the mental sheath, the wisdom sheath, the bliss sheath, and beyond. They are usually shown as if they are located in the physical body, but they are not.</p><p>Each chakra is a rotating vortex of energy that creates pressure, drawing consciousness toward its core, as well as radiating outward creating an energy field extending into one’s aura.</p><p>The seven chakras represent the following energetic vortexes:</p><p>Chakra 1:</p><p>unconsciousness/zombie/imploded ego</p><p>Chakra 2:</p><p>erotic fusion</p><p>Chakra 3:</p><p>fury/rage/domination</p><p>Chakra 4:</p><p>surrender/divine love</p><p>Chakra 5:</p><p>wisdom/higher intelligence</p><p>Chakra 6:</p><p>command/mastery over mind</p><p>Chakra 7:</p><p>Emptiness/Supreme Self/Liberation from maya/Nirvana</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Lower Assemblage Points</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Located between two chakras is a base that we call an <strong>assemblage point</strong>.<br /><br />At each assemblage point, the ego takes on different capacities, values, desires, and fears, which are organized by its balance between the two chakras it feeds from.</p><p>Chakra 1.5 -<br />Clinging Point:</p><p>Adults stuck at the first assemblage point will be needy and dependent, with separation anxiety, and lacking self-confidence.</p><p>Chakra 2.5 – <br />Dispossession Point:</p><p>Those in the second assemblage point will be angry, rebellious, and passive-aggressive. They will often be tempted irresistibly by chakra two.</p><p>Chakra 3.5 – <br />Disillusionment Point:</p><p>Psychological adulthood begins in the third assemblage point. One becomes disillusioned with its childish fantasies, and decides to become a productive, responsible, and mature member of society.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Sublimation Channels</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The energies of chakra three can be used positively, not aggressively, to assert the right to live a divine life and follow the heart to chart a course all one’s own, without needing the approval of others.<br /><br />There are three main strategies, or sublimation channels, that those in assemblage point 3.5—the disillusionment point—tend to choose to open up access to higher levels of their Being:</p><ul><li>The <strong>aesthetic path</strong>: The focus on art, music, dance, drama, cinema, or literature will awaken sensitivity to the higher and deeper reaches of human nature. One’s creative intelligence and appreciation for beauty will be activated, and one may start to download amazing new ideas and inspirations.</li><li>The <strong>ethical path</strong>: In this approach to inner growth, one chooses to follow a discipline, to live a morally upright life, and even to study such subjects as law, rhetoric, philosophy of ethics, and organizational processes. One may decide to become a leader oneself.</li><li>The <strong>religious path</strong>: One may be drawn to study theology, to attend rituals, to engage in prayer, meditation, charitable service, or go on a pilgrimage.

This is our final meeting of the first series, and we have chosen to culminate our initiation into the principles and practices of Sat Yoga by situating it in the context of the history of yoga itself. Yoga&#8217;s history parallels human history in general, because the science of yoga has always been intended to serve the society in which it functioned. The shift in the focus and processes of yoga therefore mirror the changes that have occurred in human consciousness, and we can apply these insights to our own psychology and thus come to understand why a new approach to yoga has been necessary&mdash;and how Sat Yoga has remained true to the original yoga that we shall refer to as Adi Sat Yoga.</p>\n<p>You remember that yoga means union, connection, or attunement. The word <em>Adi</em> means original, ancient, or primordial. The original yoga was intended to connect the ordinary level of human consciousness with its inner source, which has always been called <em>Sat</em>: Being or the Real Self. Since there has always been a need for such a connection, yoga has been practiced since the dawn of history. But in its early period, people were still so naturally attuned that no special techniques were required. The initiation by a Self-realized teacher involved only a simple explanation of where to focus one&#8217;s attention and students would be able to make the connection easily. In fact, yoga was often taught in silence. The teacher would simply meditate with the student, and soon they would both be resonating at the same vibrational frequency of the core Self, and they would enjoy the egoless, unbounded, ecstatic immersion in the infinite ocean of consciousness that contains the entire universe within itself. The attainment of the Absolute Self was that easy to achieve, so no rituals were required, no scriptures, no ascetic practices, no difficult ordeals, or complicated practices. The instruction was as simple as &ldquo;just be&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You are the Absolute&rdquo;, or even more simply, &ldquo;Thou art That&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>But the situation gradually changed as human consciousness became more estranged from its core of Pure Awareness and focused on the objective world and the calculating mind. We also became more conditioned by culture and lived less in the spontaneous flow of our essence. We became more stressed and prone to violence on an individual as well as a social level, and yogis began to opt out of the increasingly rigidified social structures and went to live on the margins of society in hermitages or caves in the mountains, and there they could retain their connection to nature and to the supernature of consciousness. People who were troubled would come to them for instruction and healing. The early teachers of yoga revealed how to reach the Supreme Self and the Ultimate Reality. More extended teachings were given, and students began to write them down in texts. The messages were delivered in mantras, in metaphors, parables, mythologies, and also in philosophy.</p>\n<p>The first texts were called the <em>Upanishads</em>, which are the inner teachings. The texts gradually became systematized as metaphysics. Yoga practice was based on the highest ethical principles of action and purity of heart in order to guide students living in more and more alienated conditions to live within a superstructure of right conduct called <em>Dharma</em> in order to remain attuned to the core Self (I&#8217;ll also put that word on the board, Dharma). and thus were able to, when living in this Dharma, respond intuitively in accord with higher wisdom.</p>\n<p>The great question that yogis have always asked is &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; Yoga is the inner exploration of consciousness. As culture became more estranged from nature, the human ego complex became more confused, more split internally, and more inauthentic, and yogis were tasked with the function of helping seekers understand themselves.</p>\n<p>The science of yoga answered other questions, such as: What is the nature of a person? What is the power that creates consciousness? What is the relationship of awareness to thought? Why is there a world at all? Who is in charge? Who created all of this? And what is our destiny? Does life have a meaning? What is time and what happens to us after death? Ultimately, what is the right way to live?</p>\n<p>One of the first things discovered by yogis was that all happens in consciousness. There is only consciousness. The world is like a dream, and by silencing the mind, yogis realized the world is only made of thoughts&mdash;interpretations of information. But all that is real is the vibrational frequency of consciousness itself.</p>\n<p>Yogis recognize the division of consciousness into the relative mind that thinks with language, and the Absolute mind that is pure awareness for which there is no world, only the light of consciousness itself. The Absolute is beyond description, but it offers complete peace, and the relative mind, on the other hand, is constantly making decisions and choices, distinctions, judgments, and suffers from emotional disturbances and incoherence. The relative or ego mind uses binary logic of yes, no, true, false, right, wrong, which literally traps the thinker into seeing reality in black and white terms. Nuance and paradox, the subtlety of multiple meaning levels all get obscured, and thus the ego-mind operates one-dimensionally, with tunnel vision, and creates its own suffering by projecting its false beliefs onto reality, which produces negative feedback or <em>karma</em>.</p>\n<p>As the Bible accurately put it, we ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, black and white thinking, and thus we lost paradise and dropped into a hell realm. Shunyamurti says that &ldquo;Yogis further recognized that everything is impermanent and interdependent with everything else. Our desires can never be satisfied. Nothing is secure. We only have the present. But when we live in the now, we are whole. The present is all there is if we accept the terms of the real and abide in presence. In inner silence, we discover a peace that passeth understanding. But when we fall into the ego-mind, we suffer all the limitations that time, space, body, and language impose on the consciousness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet, as society became more complex and the division of labor required more specialization, we were forced to identify with our thinking abilities and our functionality. We focused on doing, not being. The social and political order also demanded that certain beliefs be accepted, and those who thought differently were persecuted and banished. The ego learned to censor information that was dangerous or inconvenient, and the ego structure developed a subconscious sector and a central controlling agency that determined for the consciousness what it was allowed to know and to remember and to be curious about and to feel.</p>\n<p>And in this way, the subconscious mind usurped control of our lives and limited our full potential consciousness, cutting our awareness off from the core self, as we learned in Class Four. This degrading of consciousness through time has affected the practice of yoga. The more time went on, the harder it was for people to connect with their true nature, to stop the obsessive thinking of the ego, to overcome guilty feelings internalized as superego voices, and to live fully and authentically. The historical devolution of consciousness into evermore fragmented, contracted, and distorted ego structures necessitated alterations in yoga to get past ego defenses that prevented realization of the core Self. The ego&#8217;s conditioning and its ignorance of its true nature were the causes of suffering and the obstacles to healing. Eventually, yoga became subject to the same forces, and it began to devolve and lose its focus and its power to bring Liberation.</p>\n<p>So we can distinguish ten significant phases of this process, which have resulted in the successive development of ten different major forms of yoga. So, to repeat, the first masters of yoga were fully enlightened and were able to transmit the vibrational frequency of Absolute Presence without words. They could bring a student&#8217;s mind to stable silence and transcendent ecstasy with ease and without the need for techniques or processes. Eventually, this effortless transmission no longer worked because the ego defenses were too thick and tenacious. The gurus also discovered that different personality types needed different approaches. People had to be addressed at their own level of intelligence and maturity with teachings they could understand.</p>\n<p>So, the first shift in the form of yoga was the development of Raja Yoga. The word <em>Raja</em> means king or sovereign. It was the yoga of becoming sovereign over your mind. It became the science of meditation. Many different techniques were tried, and these included the repetition of mantras&mdash;phrases linked to the idea of the Supreme Self. And Raja Yoga became the main mode of classical yoga systematized by a sage named Patanjali in the famous Yoga Sutras.</p>\n<p>His version of Raja Yoga had eight limbs. One entered a school of Raja Yoga by taking vows, referred to as the <em>yamas</em> and the <em>niyamas</em>, of moral rectitude, purity of heart and mind, total focus on spiritual elevation, and surrender to God. Then one would be taught the correct meditation posture, <em>asana</em>; the right way to breathe in meditation called <em>pranayama</em>; how to withdraw the attention from the external world to the internal awareness, <em>pratyahara;</em> stabilization of focus, <em>dharana</em>; steady, one pointed abidance in silent presence, <em>dhyana</em>; and finally, attainment of the dropping away of the ego identity and effortless merging into the infinite, timeless, luminous, blissful awareness known as, of course, <em>samadhi</em>. And this is still the basic format of Sat Yoga. Eventually, the classic forms of Raja Yoga no longer worked for most students, and new approaches had to be developed. The ego-mind was too stubborn and too filled with anxiety for people to be able to sit for long periods to meditate. The vibrational frequency of the ego mind became too low to employ mantras without getting bored, sleepy and dispersed, spaced out, or lost in fantasies.</p>\n<p>Thus, a more intellectual approach was tried, and this was called <em>Gyana Yoga</em>. Gyana means spiritual knowledge or <em>gnosis</em>. This mode of yoga uses our cognitive intelligence, and one had to be able to discern that the Self cannot be the body, nor is the Self the thinking mind. Since most thoughts came unbidden, they were clearly unrelated to the free will of the witnessing consciousness, and one used such observations to come to the conclusion that the Self must be the silent awareness only. By extracting awareness from thoughts, one could stabilize in the I Am-ness.</p>\n<p>Gyana yogis categorized the kinds of thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes which got in the way of remaining as the witness. Attachment to egoic thoughts kept the Self hidden. Gyana Yoga thus consists of observation, recognition, and release of the ego&rsquo;s attachments. This is followed by turning attention inward, to the Emptiness, the unconditioned presence without name or form.</p>\n<p>Gyana eventually proved insufficient to halt the busy mind. The witness state could no longer be kept separate from the emotion-laden ego. Thus, more active and emotional approaches were needed, and this led to the initial success of the next form: Bhakti Yoga. <em>Bhakti</em> means devotion. The Bhakti Yoga approach was dualistic. The ego would no longer stop thinking in order to apperceive the deeper Self. Thus, yogis focused instead on a projected image of the Self as God, and through devotional practices, altered states of consciousness could be reached by means of chanting, and trance dancing, and prostrating to God with love, yearning, and submission. Meditation became the silent chanting of songs to God. Rituals and prayers triggered feelings of joy, surrender, and grace. The arts of drama, music, dance, poetry, and painting developed as means to promote states of devotion to help bring a person into an exalted feeling of beatitude, bathing in the healing balm of the presence of God.</p>\n<p>But devotional yoga eventually ceased to result for most people in God-realization. So, Shunyamurti explains, &ldquo;In the modern secular period, our culture broke with its theistic orientation, and turned to rationalism, empiricism, naturalism as the way to relate to reality. Scientism became the new religion, which was a cult of materialism, atheism, and inevitably, nihilism. Once cut off from access to higher consciousness and its consolations, the ego became ever more dependent on sensual gratification to cover over its lack of being.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So Bhakti Yoga had worked on the basis of conjuring up sublime emotions. Then, its methods were diverted into secular forms and the manipulation of emotions took another turn. Commercial art, pop music, cinema, advertising and political propaganda used psychological techniques for worldly purposes. Yoga, like everything else in the postmodern age, had to adapt to capitalism. It spread and became globalized and commercialized. A new, physically focused form of yoga then developed, hatha yoga, and became wildly popular. At first, it was deployed as a means of sustaining or regaining health, and it was based on an elaborate system of stretches and balancing poses, inversions and strengthening isometric muscular exercises that were still vaguely connected to spiritual ideas and intentions. In addition, breathing practices called pranayamas were developed that offered both health benefits and brief altered states of consciousness. Hyperventilation and the slowing down of respiration were both employed, but the commercialized yoga movement soon entered a more narcissistic phase and became an excuse to exhibit one&#8217;s body in tights and promoted pseudo-spiritual celebrity worship. Hatha Yoga was the perfect successor to the earlier forms of yoga because it required discipline on a body level, and since one could no longer tame one&#8217;s mind, one could at least enjoy a sense of mastery of the body in every practice session, followed by a short meditation that justified the assertion that this was a spiritual practice.</p>\n<p>Another form of yoga also developed, one less popular, but which was soon widely applied to psychotherapy. And this was Swapna Yoga, which is the yoga of dream work. <em>Swapna</em> means dream in Sanskrit. Our dreams are important and meaningful artifacts of everyone&#8217;s conscious life. So naturally a branch of yoga focused on dreams. Dream interpretation, lucid dreaming, and sensitivity to waking dreams, visions and synchronicities are all included in Swapna Yoga. The dream is a communication from the superconscious, and thus it functions as a bridge. Meditation on one&#8217;s dreams can become a form of spiritual practice.</p>\n<p>Another yoga that was developed was one that we call Mandalic Yuga. A mandala is a picture that applied specific geometric forms to guide the eye movements into altered states of consciousness, and Mandalic Yoga became very popular in the Sufi traditions, and Islamic mosques are examples of massive temples of Mandalic Yoga. The stained glass windows and Gothic cathedrals also fulfilled the same purpose. The principles of Mandalic Yoga were used in Zen and Taoist art to produce a sense of vast emptiness and timelessness. Tibetan <em>thankas</em> are well known for their use in meditation as well. Most famously, Carl Jung discovered the therapeutic value of making mandalas, since they could bring the suppressed self to the surface.</p>\n<p>At its highest level, Mandala Yoga is the expression of nature&#8217;s unfoldment and self-display as majestic mathematical intelligence. Beauty itself, in her archetypal forms, were depicted. The Greek philosophers were also attuned to this yoga. In fact, one was not granted entrance into Plato&#8217;s Academy unless one could demonstrate an understanding of geometry. And we can trace this knowledge back to the sages of ancient Egypt, who were the great Masters of sacred geometry, basing the astonishing architecture of their temples and pyramids on the symbolic meanings and powers inherent in the geometric arts expressing the deepest secrets of nature.</p>\n<p>So Shunyamurti says that, &ldquo;The focus then shifted from space to time. The Pythagorean yogis in ancient Greece developed the understanding of mathematical order in time and frequency expressed as music. The golden mean, the Fibonacci number series, and other mathematical archetypes fractally expressed at every scale of nature&#8217;s manifestation, evoked the wonder of the sages throughout the ancient world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The masters of Mandala Yoga were able to transmit the essence of this divine intelligence and invoke feeling states of awe that irresistibly accompanied the comprehension of patterns and relationships omnipresent in space and time as the signature and the proof of the reality of the mind of God, and meditation upon such patterns serve to develop the mathematical intelligence of human beings, linking them as well to the other archetypal forms of intelligence accessible through yoga. The Greek philosophers downloaded many of the same ideas as the yogis of India were receiving in the same era. And the yogis of India went deeper, however, because they understood God in a more accurate way. To the Greeks and later to all the Abrahamic religions, God is one. The oneness of God is the fundament of their religious truths. However, the Sat Yogis of ancient India realized that God is not one but zero. By discovering the Zero Point, which is the meaning of the name Shiva, these yogis were able to reach infinite consciousness and transcend the world. The cultures of the west were not interested in transcending the world, but in dominating it. The Western powers were stymied, however, by their stunted capacity to develop technology, and the failure can be pinpointed to the delayed development of higher mathematics. This was held back for one reason: The West never discovered the zero. Without that, many branches of mathematics and engineering were literally inconceivable. The problem was finally solved when the Mughals, after conquering part of India, stole the secret displayed in every temple to Lord Shiva and brought it to the West.</p>\n<p>Once the zero, which is shaped like a Shiva Lingam, not accidentally, was incorporated into mathematical thought, the technological capacities of the West rapidly accelerated. The societies of the East used this spiritual knowledge to abide at peace in attunement to the divine order. The West, however, used the knowledge to win at war. Thus, technology ushered in the age of imperialism and colonialism. We have now reached the endpoint of this historic movement. The whole world is armed to the teeth with doomsday weapons, and at any moment the mathematical intelligence granted to us by the grace of God, will be used to destroy God&#8217;s creation. But is it also not accidental that Lord Shiva is known in India as the destroyer of worlds? Did Shiva confer these boons for exactly this reason?</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that the famous Shiva Nataraj statue, for example, was chosen as the central symbol at CERN, the most advanced physics laboratory in the world. It is also the logo of our wisdom school.</p>\n<p>So Shunyamurti teaches us that, &ldquo;Correct understanding of the Supreme Real enables us to grasp the significance of the coming Singularity, the relationship between matter and antimatter, the implications of the phenomenon of magnetism, lightning and electricity, interstellar plasma, and many other aspects of reality. One idea, the concept of the universe as a hologram, a matrix, a simulation, has already caught on in the popular mind. Other important concepts include hyperspace and the manipulation of quantum wave functions via the modulation of quantum fields. The potencies of consciousness have still only been touched upon in the West.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ability to tap into the intelligence of the Zero Point may yield the ability to redream the universe, and this will be the subject of our advanced courses.</p>\n<p>For the mandalic yogi, the universe itself and everything in it is recognized as a mandala. Everything is alive with consciousness, with mathematical intelligence. Think of the perfection of crystals, the chemical elements, the fine tuning of the entire universe and its physical laws to enable the arising of intelligent life in the recognition of the ecosystemic intelligence of nature, the complete interconnection of everything to everything else as a single whole, the universe as one superorganism. The mind then opens to the great wonderment that leads to meditative silence. Life is logic,<em> logos</em>. This unfolds as fields, forces, dynamics, structure, complexity, emergence, and finally chaos. The end is the beginning. This is true of human psychology as well as of outer nature&mdash;as above so below.</p>\n<p>The study of human psychology, its repair from trauma and its development to the higher reaches of soul, consciousness, and pure spirit, developed into another famous form of yoga, which we have already discussed in the previous class, Kundalini Yoga.</p>\n<p>This yoga of psychospiritual development has become the basis of transpersonal psychology and is used to determine the most accurate spiritual practices for people, depending on where their consciousness is located on the map.</p>\n<p>The eighth yoga is Mahavakya Yoga, which is the science of great speech. <em>Maha</em> is great, <em>Vakya</em> is speech, and it offers to its masters the power of adept, oral expression of truth to transmit enlightenment, empowerment, healing, and magic spells of extraordinary breadth. On a more everyday level, it enables deep heart to heart conversations. This form of yoga, too, will be included in our advanced curriculum.</p>\n<p>The Ten Yogas have been combined into the new field of clinical atmanology, the practical science of raising consciousness from ego to Atman. The principles and practices of this developing field are also part of Sat Yoga and will be covered in future courses.</p>\n<p>The ninth yoga is Karma Yoga, and <em>karma</em> means action, and Karma Yoga is the science of accurate action, the way of being and behaving that produces optimal outcomes, which means good karma. And Karma Yoga is action performed in God-consciousness, as service to God, and thus to the world. It must be done in a spirit of generosity and purity, love, humility, detachment, joy, and gratitude, and it requires great maturity and sensitivity and compassion, empathy, and finally, loyalty.</p>\n<p>If you do good karma, you will feel better. You psychologically earn the right to be at peace with yourself and to live with an open heart, an open mind, an active intelligence, and with ever greater capacities of action. The more you serve God, the more you receive the grace of God. Understanding the laws of karma enables us to live more intelligently, successfully, and happily. In Buddhist yoga, this form of practice is the way to become a Bodhisattva and then attain full Buddhahood.</p>\n<p>The Taoist sages have referred to this practice as effortless action in spontaneous accord with the Way. Once we are aligned with the Way, the Will of God, we qualify for the final form of yoga, Nisarga Yoga. The tenth development of yoga, in its last manifestation in the cycle of time, literally means the science of being natural, or our nature as beings. It is the return to our innate, inherent, eternally, present core Self, the intelligence of nature that we embody when our consciousness is given over to the Real Self, and the Real Self is none other than the Zero Point. We are fast approaching the historic moment when the Real will erupt into manifestation. Teilhard de Chardin referred to this as the Omega Point. It is the end, but also the beginning, and we refer to it as the Singularity.</p>\n<p>Nisarga Yoga is a subject that can only be explored once we have reached more advanced levels of understanding and meditative practice. But the future of humanity involves the attainment of infinite consciousness because this is our nature as manifestations of divine intelligence in its fullness. Our spiritual potential must now be actualized and Sat Yoga is intended to lead to this ultimate attainment.</p>\n<p>So although the development of the various Yogas resulted from a fall in consciousness, that fall also is the cause of a sudden rise to the highest level&mdash;why I put Nisarga in red now&mdash;made necessary in order to meet the challenge of facing the impending apocalypse.</p>\n<p>Because it is the will of that infinite intelligence to reveal itself in its fullness, the unfoldment of our destiny does not depend on human efforts. A disbelieving world of cynical humans, rendered impotent and hopeless slaves by the very development of the technology of which they were so proud, can now only be saved by a surrender to God. This is the divine sense of humor and the victory of good over evil, of love over hate, and faith over fear. Through meditative attunement to the Supreme Self, we can participate in this beautiful unfoldment.</p>\n<p>This ends our introduction to Sat Yoga and all the Yogas of which it is composed, and of its principles, practices and ultimate purpose. We look forward to offering you more advanced courses in the near future. But you are already prepared with enough knowledge to move deeper in your inner exploration of the source and power of consciousness. You have the ability now to abide in silent presence and dissolve the ego boundaries to discover the infinite resources of your Being. You are That, Real Being. Limitless Intelligence, Eternal Bliss, Sat Chit Ananda. Discover who you are.</p>\n<p>So for now, farewell on your hero&#8217;s journey. May you attain complete and final liberation, enlightenment and joy.</p><p><strong>Transcription: </strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://courses.satyoga.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/The-Ten-Yogas.pdf">The Ten Yogas.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Audio File</strong>: <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mcdn.podbean.com/mf/web/2meeed/Class_7_Final_Final_Final-converted7z6hw.mp3">The Ten Yogas &#8211; Audio MP3</a></p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Class Description & Objectives</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The culminating class of this course explores the history of Yoga itself, and outlines the ten forms of yoga which have shifted in accord with devolutionary changes that have occurred in human consciousness over time.

The original Yoga was intended to connect the ordinary level of human consciousness with its inner source—which has always been called Sat, that is, Being, or the Real Self.</li><li>Yoga’s history parallels human history in general, because the science of Yoga has always been intended to serve the society in which it functioned.</li><li>Yoga has mirrored the changes that have occurred in human consciousness and eventually began to devolve and lose its focus and its power to bring liberation.</li><li>The historical devolution of consciousness into ever more fragmented, contracted, and distorted ego structures, necessitated alterations in Yoga to get past ego defenses that prevented realization of the core Self.</li><li>If we can apply these insights to our own psychology, we can come to understand why a new approach to Yoga has been necessary, and how Sat Yoga has remained true to the original Yoga.</li></ul><p>"Yogis further recognized that everything is impermanent and interdependent with everything else. Our desires can never be satisfied. Nothing is secure. We have only the present. But when we live in the Now, we are whole. The present is all there is. If we accept the terms of the Real and abide in presence, in inner silence, we discover a peace that passeth understanding. But when we fall into the ego mind, we suffer all the limitations that time, space, body, and language impose on the consciousness. Yet, as society became more complex, and the division of labor required more specialization, we were forced to identify with our thinking abilities and our functionality. We focused on doing, not being."</p><p>~Shunyamurti</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Ten Yogas</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>We can distinguish ten significant phases of this process which have resulted in the successive development of 10 different major forms of yoga.</p><p>Raja Yoga:</p><p>The word <em>raja</em> means king or sovereign. It is the Yoga of becoming sovereign over your mind. It became the science of meditation.</p><p>Gyana Yoga:</p><p>Gyana means spiritual knowledge, or gnosis.

The course has expanded my understanding in a way I could not imagine before I started it.</p><p>The zoom meetings with Radha Ma were genius, they added depth and width to the filmed lessons and additional materials. It also was very enriching to meet in real time with Radha Ma, who – like Shunyamurti of course – is a blessed teacher, and to meet with the other “students”. Their questions are often my questions, even if I didn’t know I had the question.</p><p>After having studied the lessons several times I find it easier to follow and understand Shunyamurti's other teachings and guided meditations. And the Kundalini map really works as a tool! It is amazing.</p>\t\t\n\t\t<p>~Elisabeth, Sweden</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href="https://courses.satyoga.org/checkout/?add-to-cart=10962" role="button">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPurchase Now: $95\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>	===LESSON_END===
