This class offers insight into the purpose, value, and meaning of meditation, and defines a variety of terms used throughout the course, such as awareness, consciousness, presence, and ego.\n\nSo let’s talk about meditation, which is a part of what we teach at this school.\n\nSo I wanted to be very clear for the people here for the first time, that it’s a school of wisdom, and a school of all of the different subjects that the ancient yoga included, and meditation is perhaps the central activity, but includes a lot more than that. But for this weekend, especially because of your interests and intentions, we will be focusing on meditation.\n\nOddly enough, in Sanskrit, which is the language of the original yogis, there is no word for <em>meditation</em>. There are many words for different levels of meditation, but meditation itself is a Western word and the word <em>medi</em> comes from the same root at “middle”, Medieval, the <em>Middle</em> Ages, the <em>medi</em>um, <em>medi</em>an. So it means to find the center of your being, your heart, and to be able to live out of that center where you are in balance—your equanimity, tranquility, clarity—and you are able to maximize your powers of expression, of creativity, of intelligence, of love, of graceful action. You are able to lead a whole life and to feel fulfilled in your life. And so you are able to be joyous.\n\nOne of the key terms of the of yoga and of the whole philosophy of yoga, is <em>Sat Chit Ananda</em>, as the three aspects of our Real Self, our full, whole Self. The <em>Sat</em> is the “Being”, which includes willpower, and that <em>Chit</em> involves our “intelligence” and <em>Ananda</em> means “bliss”. So when you have realized your complete Self, you will be blissful, infinitely intelligent, and have a sense of being that is eternal and always empowered. OK, you like that? That’s your true nature. That’s everyone’s real nature, and we have lost that and we live in a kind of a subset of the wholeness of our potential consciousness. And the yogic techniques are in order to expand your consciousness to include all of those things that have been left out of the operational level of your consciousness that causes you to function, and that you identify with.\n\nBut you are much more than you think you are. OK? So meditation is in order to get you to beyond the level of your thinking mind, to be able to realize those levels of consciousness that usually are beyond the focused level of what we identify with. And so it includes many latent capacities that we have not yet activated. It includes many things that we would put in what Freud called “the unconscious”, and the truth is the unconscious is not really unconscious at all. It is the conscious that is unconscious of the unconscious. OK?\n\nSo, therefore, it’s not really a good word to use, and rather than use the term “consciousness” for the wholeness, I would like to use the word <em>presence</em>. I could also use the word <em>awareness</em>, but I realized in my time in Costa Rica that there’s no word in Spanish for awareness; it’s always been very difficult in whatever group we get to find a word that’s a real synonym for awareness, so I think presence is a very good word. I’ve noticed in some books that I’ve read in Spanish that involve these concepts, that they use the term <em>presenciación</em>, so in a sense they’re using the term presence already, but we need to understand: what is presence? What is awareness? What do we mean by that?\n\nAnd we want to use the word consciousness, but to use consciousness for that level of awareness that is focused on a particular object and that functions using language to label, to judge, to plan, to act through the body. So consciousness will refer to that focused approach that is within the subject-object duality. “I want to do this. I want to get that.” Right? There is always an intention of the subject toward an object. But awareness is not like that. It’s not focused on objects, and it doesn’t consider itself to be an object, whereas the subjectivity of consciousness we usually refer to as the “ego”. The “I” that’s based on that thought that “I am identified with a body and with a mind that thinks, and that has desires.” Whereas when we talk about awareness or presence, what we mean is a field of consciousness. The entire field of consciousness in which you find yourself. OK?\n\nWe don’t usually learn in school to be aware of awareness. We are not aware that there is an entire field, and we learn to focus on a particular object within the field. If you’re playing football, you’re focused on the ball, you’re not focused on the whole field, and the crowd in the stands or whatever. You’re focused on one particular element, and you want to achieve a goal with that element. “I want to make money”—that could be the object. “I want to pick up this person in the bar. I want to get these groceries. I want to do this or that.”\n\nBut there’s always an intention, and a focus, and a worry that you won’t achieve what you want to get in that moment. Whereas the presence is simply non-judgmentally taking in all that is. OK? So it’s a very different approach to your ability to be aware of your surroundings, your mind, your heart, your feelings—everything that you would consider to be external and internal.\n<ol>\n \t<li>Can you imagine living from the center of your being? What does it look like? What does it feel like?</li>\n \t<li>Do you feel you are living authentically from your heart? If not, what is stopping you?</li>\n \t<li>Do you believe meditation can help you to expand your consciousness? If so, in what ways? Please feel free to express in writing how you may have ‘imperienced’ this aspect of your practice.</li>\n \t<li>Do you have a new understanding of presence, awareness, and consciousness from this class? What is the difference? How are they perceived? Take some time to contemplate and write in your journal about your perspective.</li>\n</ol>	===LESSON_END===

Learn how to breathe away tension in this short and simple meditation exercise for instant stress relief. Attention reveals tension. Awareness allows the unconscious to become conscious. And what you are aware of you can let go of.\n\nSo, let’s begin by doing a first exercise which is: right now, be aware of how your body feels. Just be aware if there’s nervousness, if there are any areas of tightness, is there a knot in the stomach, are there any pains, are there any kinks, are there any areas of discomfort. And just be aware of them. Don’t try to do anything about it necessarily, but just be aware.\n\nAnd in this awareness, take three deep breaths, and breathe out the stress, breathe out any negativity, any knots, and with each breath, make them abdominal breaths so you’re really breathing out deeply. Breathe in so the abdomen comes out, and then breathe it out. Breathe in the nose and out through the mouth three times.\n\nNow be aware of your body again. Is it different? Is it more relaxed? Can you be more present in your body, and to your body?\n\nHow many people felt a difference after you took the breaths? Great. So that’s technique one. Three deep breaths and you’ll probably be twice as relaxed as you were before. But it wasn’t just the breaths. It was your awareness of the body. You’re paying attention to the body. Otherwise, if you just take the breaths you won’t have the same affect. It was that paying of attention that allowed the body to reveal itself to you, and through the awareness to release whatever had been un-perceived, had been unconscious, to become conscious, and then it could be let go of.\n\nSo consciousness is very important. What you <em>feel</em>, you can <em>heal</em>. What you are aware of, you can let go of. If you’re not aware of the knots in your stomach, you’re not going to let go of them, no matter whether you breathe or stretch or do whatever; you have to be aware. And very often the awareness itself is sufficient without even the breaths.\n\nSo during the weekend, I want you to do this exercise every time that you feel stressed or even every time you sit down for the class, or any time in between, just take a moment and notice the body and just be, aware, cognizant of whether just noticing it for a few seconds even, or a minute, will reduce the stress. And then take the three deep breaths and see if that reduces it even more. So just that alone is something you can do without needing to do a half hour meditation, and clear your space, and could be an instant stress relief. And it is a meditation, because the awareness itself is taking you out of focused consciousness into presence in your body.\n\n<strong>Breathe Away Stress and Tension: Exercise Instructions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Start by being aware of how your body feels–is there nervousness, tightness, pain, areas of discomfort, or not?</li>\n \t<li>Continue to just be aware.</li>\n \t<li>Begin taking deep, abdominal deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth. With each breath, breathe out any stress, negativity, tightness or tension.

Notice as a profound sense of peace begins to pervade the practice. Shunyamurti explains how an energy field of peace can be cultivated within one’s inner world and shared as a gift with the outer world.\n\nOK, now let’s do a second exercise, and this time be aware of how your body feels in the space of this room. Just take a moment, you can do with your eyes open. Just be aware how you feel, in this energy field. And as you’re being aware of it, does the awareness itself calm you down? Do you become more free of stress, more peaceful, just being aware of the energy?\n\nNow again, let’s take three deep abdominal breaths while you’re aware of the environment of the room and its impact on your body, and let’s see what happens.\n\nOK, again how many people feel more peaceful after the breathing? How many people already felt good before the breathing just feeling the energy field of the room? Great. The reason that the energy field is good, is that there are a group of people here who are in a peaceful state. And who are here to become more peaceful, and we are emanating that energy of peacefulness and of harmony, without conflict, with openness, and we are emanating that energy to one another. We are sharing it. We are in an energy field in which the energy of each one of us is potentiated, and accelerated, and increased by everyone else’s presence and there’s a sharing.\n\nQuantum physics has discovered that every particle in the universe, every entity, every being, is entangled with every other. This quantum entanglement operates even more powerfully with the human consciousness. And so we have an effect on one and other. And that’s why if you come into a room full of people who are at peace and who are in a state of joy, and love, and positivity, you can be healed of whatever symptoms of suffering you may have, much more easily than if you’re in a room full of angry, stressed-out people.\n\nAnd just being in an energy field that’s positive in itself is often enough to heal whatever ails you.\n\nOne of the greatest gifts we can give to the world is simply emanating that energy of peace and sharing it with people, even if they don’t know it, they will feel it at some level, and be helped by it to be more peaceful.\n\n<strong>Be Aware of the Present Moment: Exercise Instructions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Start by being aware of how your body feels in the space of the room. You can do this with your eyes open or closed.</li>\n \t<li>Take three abdominal breaths while remaining in this state of awareness.</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Reflection Questions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Take a moment to reflect after the exercise: Do you feel more calm? Free of stress? Peaceful?</li>\n \t<li>How do you relate the concept of quantum entanglement presented in this class to the practice of meditation?</li>\n \t<li>Can you feel when you enter into a high vibrational room or energy field?

This simple exercise reveals that the peace and freedom achieved through meditation practice is open to everyone equally, simply because it is the truth of your nature.\n\nOK, so now let’s do another exercise that uses the breath a little more intensely, and for this exercise we’ll close our eyes, and we will breathe in through the nose and out through either the nose or the mouth, but abdominal breathing. But when you breathe in, count one to yourself, and breathe out, count two, breathe in, count three, breathe out, four; breathe up to ten, and then start over at one and do a second round. And then do a third round, OK? And at the same time, observe and be present to how your body relaxes as you go through the counting of the breaths. And don’t pay attention to anything else, don’t let your mind wander to other things, just focus on the counting and on the awareness of how your body feels as you count the breaths.\n\nOK, let’s begin. Take it as slow as you wish.\n\nOK, is everyone done breathing? Do you feel more relaxed now than you did before you started? So now, with just that extra focus for a minute or two, we really got down several levels of stress reduction, right? And it didn’t take very long all. And notice we did this without any metaphysical commitment whatsoever. This is a technique that’s open to you whether you believe in God or you’re an atheist, or whether you have any particular belief system; it’s just breathing. Has nothing to do with your paradigm of reality. So it’s open to everyone equally to achieve this kind of peace, simply because of the nature of our reality.\n\nAnd as much as possible, we like to keep our approach as non-dogmatic as possible. This is not a religious approach. It’s spiritual, you could say, but not religious. We are not committed to any particular belief system. In fact, ultimately you want to overcome all belief systems to achieve real freedom, not be limited by anything in the mind.\n\n<strong>Breathe In, Be Present, Breathe Out, Be Peace: Exercise Instructions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Close your eyes.</li>\n \t<li>Begin abdominal breathing, in through the nose, out through the nose or mouth.</li>\n \t<li>Begin counting the inhales and exhales to yourself:\n<ul>\n \t<li>As you breathe in, count 1.</li>\n \t<li>As you breathe out, count 2.</li>\n \t<li>Breathe in, count 3.</li>\n \t<li>Breathe out, count 4.</li>\n \t<li>Continue up to 10.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Take a moment to observe and be present.

If we want to enter into deeper and more delightful states of higher consciousness, we must relax and release our defenses, and open to the energy of divine love that heals the heart. This is what meditation is about.\n\nBut along the way, to get to even deeper states than what we are now experiencing, if we add in the energy of <em>affect</em>, of emotion, of devotion, of love we will go to even more beautiful and delightful states than if we simply count the breaths and relax the muscles and get to a physically relaxed place.\n\nSo, there is something about a relationship to some ultimate reality, whether it’s out there for you, or in here, is the Self, or is Nirvana, or is Allah, or is Christ, or is whatever word or whatever form or whatever concept or whatever ultimate reality that you feel, an emotional or a affective relationship to a feeling of love for, to put it very specifically. And if you don’t have any feeling of love for a metaphysical/supernatural Real, if you have love for your grandchild, or if you have love for your dog, or your cat, or any being in the world, that love itself is what relaxes and brings joy. So it doesn’t even matter; it is the energy in the feeling of love. Not desire, but love. The pure benevolence, let’s say, of love, of reverence, which opens the heart.\n\nAnd so it’s opening the heart that is the real healing, because we have all been hurt so much in our lives by times that we have loved and the love has not been returned, or we have felt rejected, or we have felt neglected or attacked, that we, almost all of us, have shields up around our hearts. And we suffer for that. And so to whatever extent in a safe environment like this you can open your heart—not to any person, not to any situation, not to any relationship—but to love itself. Or to some word or some concept or some image that represents and signifies to you that core which you can love with safety, and with wholeheartedness let’s say. That will increase your sense of wellbeing and your joy far more than just the relaxation we’ve done.\n\nOK, so let’s do another exercise now.\n\nAgain, were going to close our eyes, but this time I’d like you to think about either a word that stands for some figure that you love. It could be a could be God, it could be some person who you feel is an avatar or a representative of God, or a saint, or a sage, or Mother Mary, or whoever it is and whatever religious framework. Or just a word that signifies love itself. It could be the word “love”. And let yourself repeat that ten times while you focus on your heart. Not your physical heart so much, but just your emotional openness, and you feel yourself letting go of whatever defenses you have against love. Loving yourself, loving the world, loving God, loving humanity, loving love.\n\nOK, so let’s take a moment. Close your eyes and find that word or image that represents that, and let yourself just feel love. Divine love, if you will, love without desire, love that’s not objectified but love that just is pure benevolence. Pure admiration, reverence, gratitude, grace. And feel what it’s like to let your heart open as you do this.\n\nOm Shanti.\n\nSo how many of you feel like your heart opened a bit in this exercise? Wonderful. Do you feel more at peace? It’s an important part of letting go of stress, isn’t it? To be able to be with an open heart as well as an open mind as well as the body that isn’t knotted up and filled with muscular tension. So we want to accomplish all three of those when we meditate. De-tense the body and relax the physical organism. We want to breathe away any stress and tension. We want to be aware of the body and of the space in which the body is functioning and feel that it’s positive, and that we can be at peace and safe in the environment, and then we want to open our heart and experience love.\n\nAnd that’s a huge percentage of what meditation is about.\n\n<strong>Heal the Heart: Exercise Instructions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Close your eyes.</li>\n \t<li>Think about a word that stands for a figure you love: God, an avatar, a representative of God, a Saint or Sage, Mother Mary, a religious figure, or just the word Love.</li>\n \t<li>Repeat this word 10 times while you focus on your heart—not your physical heart, but emotional openness.</li>\n \t<li>Feel yourself letting go of whatever defenses you have against love—loving yourself, loving the world, loving God, loving humanity, loving love.</li>\n \t<li>Let your heart open to Divine Love—without desire, unobjectified, pure benevolence, admiration, reverence, gratitude, grace.</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Reflection Questions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Do you feel that your heart opened in this exercise?

And do everything that you do, whether it’s sitting in class or it’s walking in the gardens, or if you’re doing some karma yoga, if you’re chopping carrots, or whatever you’re doing, do it for the sake of doing. And in the joy of doing whatever you’re doing. OK? Without doing it with some intention of getting somewhere else , or doing it for somebody, or because you have to, or because it’s part of something else. It’s not a means to an end. Be completely free of a “means to an end” attitude, and just be totally present in every moment and enjoy it for the sake of it. And then let’s see how that changes your whole way of feeling about being alive.\n\nAnd what will happen is, by the end of the weekend, you will realize that meditation isn’t about sitting on a <em>zafu</em> and doing some special techniques, but it is a way of life. And you can live a meditative life, which simply means a life of presence, of joy, of openness, of empowerment all the time, wherever you are. And there are no obstacles, because you have that ability. It’s just a choice to live to the fullness of your potential, and not to settle for less, and not to inhibit yourself. Not to close down, not to cheat yourself of the life energy, and the power and the joy, in the love that you have within.\n\nOK, so is much as possible, remember to be present for the sake of being present, and not for the sake of any other objective.\n\nThere will be times when you’ll forget, so the other rule is you are not allowed to beat yourself up for forgetting. You’re not allowed to say, “Oh damn I forgot! Now I gotta start all over again!” No. As soon as you forget, you remember again, and you go back to it. No judgment, OK? No self-attacks are allowed the whole weekend. There’s no such thing as failing at this, so just keep returning to it. It’s like the guy who said, “Yeah, stopping smoking is easy! I’ve done it thousands of times!” Well, the same thing in learning to remember to meditate is easy, and you’ll remember thousands of times, and eventually you won’t forget anymore. But don’t worry about it. Don’t try to rush it. Just accept the process, and become more and more aware and present, and soon that will be the habit. And your natural way of being. And you’ll never be stressed out again, regardless of whatever situation you’re in.\n\nNow, what will happen is, as you are more aware, that which was in your unconscious will become conscious. Because your awareness now is expanding to include things that you used to not let yourself know about. Some of those are going to be wonderful things, like, “Yes, I can sing, and I can play, and I can be a child again”, and all this, but there may also be, “Oh, I wasn’t such a happy child”, and, “I remember this trauma happened to me, and this terrible thing and that”, and those kinds of negative thoughts and memories may come up. But when they come up, deal with them again with pure awareness, not with judgment and not with buying into them, because they are not present, they are the past, and so as you bring presence to any negative memory, or thought, the presence itself will dissolve its pain, its suffering.\n\nAnd allow yourself to be present enough to it to say: “This is not reality now.” And let it dissolve. And if necessary, take three deep breaths, and do the other techniques, until you’ve dissolved any negativity that comes up, and say goodbye to it forever. OK?\n\nAnd so, by the end of the weekend, there will be nothing negative. No traumas left, no worries, no fears. No childhood issues that have remained with you into adulthood. No anger from things that happened yesterday or last week or at people who haven’t recognized you, or any of that.\n\nYou’ll be able to let go of all of it and be totally present—but present with your whole life as part of your presence now. And so all of time will become present. But it’ll be present as joy. As openness. As freedom. And whatever there had been in terms of pain will be transformed into wisdom, and into empowerment, and into a new beginning. Because when you are present, you are at a new beginning of your life. Automatically. The past dies, and the present means you’re reborn. And we are reborn every moment we remember to be present. And were reborn without any trauma, and without any history, and without any cause that could impinge upon our power to be happy. There’s nothing that can take that away from you, so simply don’t allow it.\n\nThe past does not control the present. And therefore, as you become more aware, you will see that the past is an illusion, and only the present is real. And because the present is peaceful, it’s good, it’s beautiful, it’s unlimited, and you are a being of unlimited capacity, potential, love, joy, all of that cleans the slate, not only of your awareness, but of your bodily condition. And heals whatever pains, whatever suffering and sorrows you had been carrying in your unconscious mind, and allows a purification of the soul, and a freeing from any baggage that you had been carrying, whether consciously or unconsciously. But do it without judgment and without worry. And if some baggage doesn’t want to leave yet, that’s OK, but just be aware of it without attacking yourself for not being ready to totally let it go yet. Just be aware of it, and know that power of awareness itself will gradually dissolve it, and you will be free. And be patient, and let everything happen in its own natural way.\n\nAnd you’ll see that by the end of the weekend your natural state, the baseline, and the state that you will be able to maintain when you leave and go back into that world, will be so empowered, so peaceful, with such an aura around you of illumination, that you will never be touched by anyone’s negative energy. It’ll bounce off of your energy aura and it won’t affect you. You will be immune to suffering.\n\nOK? So practice it with such devotion, and such intensity, and such acceptance of the truth of your power to be free, and immune to projections of others, and hurtful words, or whatever ways that people usually feel impinged on—none of it will bother you again. And no memories in your mind of being attacked by anyone, whether it’s parents, or family, or teachers, or friends, or pseudo-friends, or past relationships of any kind, none of it will sting any longer, and you’ll be aware of it, but in total peace.\n\nAnd eventually, you’ll be aware of the present with such power of joy that there will be no further reason for any memories to come up, and you’ll be in a new life that you have created through your own will to be free.\n\n<strong>Reflection Questions</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>What does it mean to you to be truly present in every moment?</li>\n \t<li>Do you notice that you are capable of being more present in certain moments rather than others?</li>\n \t<li>What does it mean to you to live a meditative life?

===LESSON_START===	11376	===TITLE===	Bonus Essay - Meditation: The Joy of Transcendence	===SLUG===	bonus-essay-meditation-the-joy-of-transcendence	===ORDER===	8	===CONTENT===	<h2>Meditation: The Joy of Transcendence</h2>\n<strong>What is meditation?</strong>\n\nMeditation is the core activity of ancient Yoga as well as nearly every other spiritual and religious tradition. In Christianity, it is called contemplative prayer. It is now used in secular contexts as well by people simply seeking inner peace and relief from stress. Science has proven its effectiveness.\n\nMeditation is the art of developing the full potentials of our consciousness. The fundamental principle is to slow down, and eventually halt, the flow of thoughts in the mind. The more silent and still is the inner space of our consciousness, the more serene, happy, and empowered we will feel.\n\nThis taming of the mind, which for most people is wild and uncontrollable, results in an extraordinary level of self-mastery. Once the mental focus has been trained to respond to our will, we can turn our attention into a laser beam of pure concentration, and achieve much higher levels of skill and effectiveness in any activity we do.\n<h3>Why should we meditate?</h3>\nWe can read faster and retain more information. We can improve our performance in every field, from business to sports to music to creative writing to critical thinking. This is because a quiet mind is more receptive to inspiration and innovative ideas.\n\nA meditative mind is more flexible, clear, and unbiased, thus more capable of making accurate decisions and changing directions when called for. A calm mind tends to be more open and loving, more able to listen deeply to others, and less egocentric.\n\nIn a meditative state, one is more likely to heal quickly from any illnesses, since the immune system is strengthened by the relaxed, even flow of life energy through the organism. This vital power in Yoga is called prana. In Chinese, the word is chi. Increasing the flow of chi is the basis of traditional Chinese medicine and all the Eastern martial arts. An advanced meditator can even direct the flow of spiritual energy to others to augment their healing and sense of wellbeing.\n\nMeditation is used by spiritually-oriented seekers to attain what has variously been called Self-realization, God-realization, enlightenment, Buddha Mind, Emptiness, the Tao, or by endless other such exalted terms.\n\nThis level of meditation is reached when the mind has learned to abide constantly in inner silence in the heart, or the core of our Being. It brings about transcendence of the ego. With that come wisdom, courage, universal love, and a lasting sense of sublime oneness with Ultimate Reality.\n\nMany advanced meditators also attest that this highest level of contemplation results in paranormal capacities, including telepathy, accurate premonitions of future events—sometimes called prophecy—and astral travel, or the ability of consciousness to journey safely out of the body to distant locations and higher dimensions. Some say it also enables subtle perception of angels, divine radiance, and other kinds of visions well known to mystics.\n<h3>How should I begin?</h3>\nTo get started meditating, there are many easy techniques for beginners. One way, used in Zen monasteries and other such centers of meditation, involves the counting of breaths.\n\nOne should begin by finding a quiet space where one will not be interrupted and sit comfortably—no difficult Yoga poses are necessary—with the back straight (not hunched over or with the torso twisted), take a few initial deep breaths to release any excess tension, and close one’s eyes to tune out visual distractions. Calming music can be playing in the background, if you wish.\n\nThen, begin to count each in-breath and out-breath. As you breathe in, think “one.” Then, as you breathe out, think “two.” Count up to ten and then start again at “one.” That is all. Keep this up for as many rounds as you wish. You will soon notice that your breathing becomes slower and more regular, and with that your metabolism will slow down, the body will spontaneously relax, and there will be a lovely feeling of peacefulness and refreshment.\n\nIf you were to hook up your head with electrodes, as is often done in laboratory tests of meditation, you would discover that your brainwaves gradually shift from beta to alpha waves, and then, if you continue long enough, into even deeper theta and delta states. These shifts have been shown to produce many positive, lasting effects on our health and personality development into more integrated wholeness.\n\nAnother popular method, for non-religious meditators, is to simply repeat a syllable or word that represents calming and relaxation to you, or even one that is meaningless, without the counting of breaths. This will have the same effects as the first technique. Of course, religious people will prefer to repeat a Name of God, a short prayer, or a mantra that has deep meaning to them and brings a sense of greater closeness with God or with whatever we conceive of as our Supreme Beingness.\n\nThere are also techniques that involve keeping the eyes open, including staring at a candle flame, a mandala, a beautiful work of visual art, or a religious icon.\n<h3>Self-inquiry</h3>\nAdvanced meditators often prefer a method called Self-inquiry. In this approach, you simply ask yourself the question, “Who am I?” Then, rather than answering the question with words, ideas or images, you search within for the center of your Being—beyond all superficial levels of identity, such as your profession or religion or gender orientation or age—and let your attention focus ever more deeply in your innermost sense of Selfhood.\n\nThis can lead to what feels like a floating, timeless state of bodiless, eternal presence, an infinite expanse of luminous and joyous energy, a sense of liberation from all worries and of profound goodness, security, and confidence that all is perfect. You will know that you are supported in your existence and empowered to live in happiness—in short, what in religious terms, would be called a state of grace.\n<h3>Mindfulness Meditation</h3>\nOne popular aspect of meditation that attracts newcomers is what has come to be called mindfulness (or vipassana, a Theravada Buddhist term). This is the process of noticing all that arises in consciousness, without reacting to it, without judging it, without identifying with it, and—most importantly—without allowing any stream of thoughts connected with it to divert one from silent presence.\n\nThis would include reacting to every itch and kink in the body, as well as to thoughts tinged with some emotion, or some extraneous task one must perform later that day, or other ideas, images, and memories that interfere with the steadiness of attention. By not reacting, all such arisings will soon disappear and inner peace will be re-established. It is important not to attack oneself for losing one’s center, as that will start a vicious cycle of negative thinking. Simply wait patiently and witness all that appears and the mind will free itself from its habitual self-deceptions.\n<h3>Should I practice alone or in a group?</h3>\nPeople considering taking up the practice of meditation often ask if it is better to sit home alone to do it, or more effective in a group setting. The answer is that a group that is led by an advanced meditator (and the more advanced the better, to be able to deal appropriately with spiritual crises that can indeed come up in this practice) and that offers a philosophy congenial to one’s own, and not demanding of blind belief in some creed, will accelerate one’s progress, for several reasons.\n\nOne is that, as just indicated, once engaged seriously in this practice, many questions will arise because of various strange mental and physical phenomena that can arise in the course of what amounts to a stirring up of the unconscious levels of the psyche through one’s sustained concentration. For the most part, this is a hygienic release of repressed shadow material from childhood (to use Carl Jung’s term), which in religious terminology would be called the purification of the soul.\n\nIt is because of the fact that our subjectivity is split into conscious, repressed, and superconscious sectors that there is both the desire to meditate—to gain true wholeness and self-understanding and mastery—and there is the inevitable arising of obstacles and moments of critical encounter with forbidden and unbearable truths. This is why it is imperative to have an ethical, highly experienced, and knowledgeable teacher if one wants to pursue this avenue of growth beyond superficial levels. It is not all hearts and flowers, but also dealing with thorns and dark nights of the soul.\n<h3>How do I gain skill in the practice of meditation?</h3>\nTo gain skill in this inner work of self-purification, other meditative approaches will eventually be required in addition to mere mindfulness. These include the capacity for analytic meditation and gyana yoga. The analytic skill covers the same ground as psychoanalysis—that of understanding repressed desires, fears, confusions, guilt feelings, and inhibitions—but does so from a simpler, more real and more spiritual paradigm of our true nature and our power to let go of the past.\n\nThis kind of ethical self-knowledge is necessary to claim the authentic self-mastery and authority over the contents of one’s own mind to be able to deconstruct any disempowering or self-sabotaging thoughts that come from the lower unconscious sectors of our psyche (which is a lot more vast and multidimensional than most of us trained in a rational, scientific paradigm imagine).\n\nOn the other hand, the gyana yoga—based on accurate knowledge of the superconscious levels of our Being, is useful in navigating the advanced stages of meditation that open up to the higher Mind—enabling us to understand and make use of the visions and insights and sublime feelings that will be received in deep Samadhi (the very advanced absorption in the innermost core of consciousness that produces the ecstatic energies and wisdom that many seekers yearn for).\n<h3>Creating an energy field</h3>\nAnother reason to choose to meditate in a group or <a href="https://www.satyoga.org/institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esoteric school</a> setting with an adept teacher (a setting that is known in Yoga as a satsang—a gathering of those seeking the inmost Truth of our Being) is that during meditation people emanate an energy field, and a group energy field is more powerful than an individual one. So just by sitting in a positive and peaceful energy field created by a number of meditators together in a room can set up a resonance effect in one’s own inner space (since all our minds are in quantum entanglement, as science has discovered) and boost one’s own vibrational energy levels enormously, to get one past the breakers of initial resistance, until one is swimming in the deep cool waters of a sea of serenity.\n<h3>Creating a regular habit</h3>\nThere are many places one can go to study and practice meditation (and of course one should make a careful and informed choice before making a commitment, since there are many charlatans and cult groups that have ulterior motives), and many books written on the subject. But the main thing is just to start doing it, and make it a regular habit—even if for only a half-hour a day. Make sure you do not go to sleep during your practice or waste your time chattering to yourself, but stay on course with your chosen technique. Soon, almost without recognizing the change, your life will take a turn for the better.\n\nPeople will tell you that you look younger and more energized. Some will ask if you just came back from a vacation. Others will notice a glow of wellbeing in your aura. Old unwanted habits will fall away by themselves, anxieties will disappear, and a positive attitude of being successful and prosperous will stay constant and actually bring new opportunities and successes into your life.\n<h3>A tool for a joyful life</h3>\nIn the challenging and stressful times we are now living in, the ability to meditate is an essential tool in helping us get the most out of life. It will keep us calm and cool when under pressure, it will give us the fearlessness to face down intimidation, and the discernment not to be taken in by the false promises or seductions of others or our own wishful projections.\n<h3>Realize unimaginable potentials</h3>\nSkill in meditation will, in short, make us wiser, without having to go through being sadder first. It will make us more realistic, with more acute “street smarts”—but we will also recognize that we live in an unlimited reality with such extraordinary potentials that those ignorant of the insights and powers gained in meditation will foolishly call them mere fantasies. Meditation is a direct path to levels of individuation and Self-discovery undreamt of by most people, and unfortunately still repressed by most of our society.\n\nSoon, if you discipline yourself from the beginning to practice even when you would rather watch TV or surf the internet, meditation will have become second nature and you will find yourself naturally meditating whenever you have a short break in the day, and that even these little dips into inner peace enrich your life more than you can express in words.	===LESSON_END===
