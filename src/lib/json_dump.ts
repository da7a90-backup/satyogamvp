According to quantum theory, subatomic particles can be in a condition of superposition—in other words, the particle can be in two states at once, until observed. Thus, the killing mechanism in the box could be both triggered and not triggered. So, Schrödinger wondered: Could the cat be both alive and dead at the same time?",

Human beings, alone of all creatures, have the power of re-designing our own psychic structure in the direction of ethical, aesthetic, cognitive, and spiritual perfection. Through the practice of Sat Yoga, we can gain the skills to alter our personalities, to align our psyche with our innermost essence, and to manifest, cultivate, and sustain the full flowering of the Godseed that lies latent within us all. The inherent powers that become activated in the event of such a self-transformation have tremendous effects upon the phenomenal plane, not only on the social and political levels, but also on the ecological and the geological. This is because gross matter responds to the vibrational transmissions of the subtle energy field of human consciousness. This little understood aspect of reality is the key to responding to the challenge of global warming as well as all the other challenges faced by humanity today. But to accomplish this, we must bring the power of the highest frequencies of our vibrational potential—we can call it Tao or Shiva, Emptiness, unitive awareness, Buddha-consciousness, or God-consciousness—into the equation as the essential engine of our will. Nothing less could suffice.",

    "description": "All myths are both memories and prophecies. The ancient myths were collective. Modern myths are products of individual imagination. The more ancient the myth, the less distortion there is. The fall through time is a loss of information, disguised as a gain of information. In the ancient world, before materialism took hold, reality was still recognized as dream. Collective amnesia had not yet fully set in. The powers of consciousness had not yet totally atrophied, as they have in accord with the collective anti-myth of materialism. The ravages of this anti-myth are of course included in every authentic myth.\nBecause of the congruence of all the world’s enduring mythologies, Campbell referred to it all as a single stream of information that he called the mono-myth. Once it has been accurately deciphered, one understands the challenge that life presents.\nThe myth is always about rites of passage. The passages are from primitive flattened infantile mental states to ever more refined sublime multidimensional states of awareness. The passage requires a death and rebirth. The death is of selfishness, narcissism, suffering—the full catastrophe produced by the egocentric frame of reference; followed by rebirth into wholeness, care, benevolence, joy, grace—the full blessing of union with the Absolute Real.\nThere is a timeless metaphysical dimension to this that makes it perennially relevant to every manifestation of the human level of consciousness, or its equivalent. But there is also a historical dimension that refers to a specific moment in chronological time when the Aeon enters via the Kairos portal into the satori of true wisdom and understanding: the moment of the full initial recognition by the ineffable Dreamer of the arrival of the sacred passage through planetary death and rebirth. The mobilization of all the world’s most titanic forces—ranging from the unleashing of the puny military, thermonuclear explosive destructive power to the far greater geophysical forces activating supervolcanoes and earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and wildfires—awakens the ultimate superforce that disguises itself as weakness and ignorance or remains utterly invisible and non-perceivable to those who are not attuned to a high enough vibrational frequency.\nThe awakening brings a rapid increase in intelligence and power. The more of the lower force that is surrendered, the more higher power is attained and harnessed, channeled into the world to multiply itself, to strengthen its self-emanating field of morphic resonance, and to transform the chaos of phenomenal flux that is breaking apart and disintegrating, into a fluidly self-reorganizing massive conscious singularity, a transcendental object in the Mind of God.\nDespite the distortions and dumbed-down presentation, despite the grating dialogue and acting and casting necessitated by the marketing of the myth to immature minds as this version of The Chronicles of Narnia must be to appear at the end of kali yuga, nonetheless the information is still there, if one knows how to apply it to one’s imperiential existence and recognize the true nature of the battle that must be won. If we are too pseudo-sophisticated to have time for fairy tales, we may miss the thread that leads to liberation.",

Capitalism is all about quantity: how much is something worth, how many are available, what will be the amount of return on my investment, how large will be my profits in the coming year, etc. Mathematics is the main instrument of social control, military power, and economic policy. Without higher mathematics, there could be no weapons of mass destruction, no electric grid, no digital surveillance, no nanotechnology for biowarfare, no geoengineering, and no agents operating with artificial intelligence. The Word creates, Number destroys. Mathematics has no meaning, no heart, no mercy. We have all become mere numbers in the social order, dehumanized and devalued as useless eaters. But there is a third language of God: the language of Silence. Word creates, Number kills, but Silence saves. To save our souls, let us learn to commune with God in Silence.",

The entity likewise constructs an unreal world on which it projects its many dissociated fragments with their desires, plus its shadow drives, foreclosed wisdom, and objects of both desire and fear.

The discourse describes the chain of effects brought about by coveting the attributes or possessions of a chosen other. These cascade from envy to imitation, to rivalry, and to some level of symptomatic violence. We must become free of scapegoating and being victimized, as well as from all rescue fantasies. There is an easy way out.",

And many are paralyzed spiritually by feelings of disgust and shame about their self-images, histories, and modes of self-presentation. In this context, Shunyamurti retells a story originally told by Acharya Sthaneshwar Timalsina about his meeting with an Aghori guru—and explores the implications of the extreme lifestyles and practices of those pariah yogis with amazing powers. Through this analysis, we learn how to raise our consciousness to new symbolic heights and then pass beyond the mind to the Supreme Real. This enables the liberated Self to emerge.",

What is required now is to act in such a way that future generations will be thankful for what we have done, the sacrifice we have made, to ensure the restoration of what is truly great and worthy in the human spirit. Let us transform this obsolete holiday into a Re-Constitution Day—we must re-constitute our nature from that of sheep into lionhearted spiritual warriors.  By making the ultimate sacrifice of the ego, recovering our nature as souls, we shall be empowered to initiate the renewal of our world to its original pristine state of beauty, secured by divine love, and sustained by noble goodness. Our heroic action now will found the culture of the future, and we can feel their gratitude even as we raise our consciousness to the infinite Self in this very moment. All thanks be to God.",

And the problem for human consciousness is that a false self has intervened to disconnect our consciousness from the Real Self. And so we must learn to recognize the Real Self. And it&#8217;s easy to do because the Real Self differs from the false self in one essential way; the Real Self is non-arising. Any self that arises as an object, as a sense of being a body in the world, as having emotions, intentions, agendas, and relations in duality with others, is the false self. The Real Self is non-arising, and from the perspective from the false self, then, the Real Self does not exist because it doesn&#8217;t arise, it&#8217;s unborn, it&#8217;s unmanifest. But what the Real Self knows is that it&#8217;s that which arises that does not really exist; it&#8217;s not real because it&#8217;s fleeting, it&#8217;s impermanent, it&#8217;s in constant change, and it&#8217;s constantly fragmented, different emotions, different attitudes, different thoughts, contradictory, conflicting, feeling, and cognition states; whereas the Real Self that&#8217;s non-arising is eternal, unchanging, immutable &#8212; untouched by the chaos of the false self.&#8221;",

Now, a Satsang, for those of you who haven&#8217;t been to one, the word &#8220;Sat&#8221; you&#8217;ll notice appears a lot in our discourse here, Sat refers to the Supreme Beingness, the truth of what we are when we take away all of the falseness and the mediated and artificial aspects of our self, when we get down to what is natural and eternal in ourselves. And yoga means &#8220;yoke,&#8221; union. . . . You know we tend to think that that it&#8217;s only people out there who sabotage our happiness, but it&#8217;s actually we who are responsible for that; we set that up. And once we assume our own responsibility for our happiness, then life begins to get a lot better. . . . And gradually our intellect, our buddhi, becomes clearer and clearer, and we begin to realize the ways that we&#8217;d been sabotaging ourselves on subtler and subtler levels until we get to the root of the phantasies that have been motivating us to deny ourselves or to cheat ourselves of our own bliss . . .&#8221;",

    "description": "&#8220;In Christianity there is a trinity as we all know: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This trinity is an archetype and exists in every religion, every spiritual path, although it has different names in different paths. . . . In the yogic path, it&#8217;s only one of a number of trinities, however; we could call it the &#8220;vertical trinity.&#8221; And the equivalent in the yogic tradition is noted by the words &#8220;Sat, Chit, and Ananda.&#8221;  . . . But there is also a horizontal trinity that is often noted by the names of three gods:&#8221; Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankara.&#8221; . . . They refer to creation, sustenance, and destruction, if you will—or transformation. But you can think of it as kind of a black board, or a white board, which is the Absolute; we could say that&#8217;s Shiva. And then on that someone writes with a pen a sentence that is a narrative, an ego narrative: the story of a civilization, the story of a culture—or the story of your own life. And then once that&#8217;s written, Vishnu repeats it over and over again; it becomes a pattern that gets sustained in one&#8217;s life. Not only sustained, but if the pattern is pathological, then stained: one&#8217;s life becomes stained by a pattern that repeats automatically, over and over again. How many of you have had the experience of making the same mistake over and over again in your life?&#8221;",

In the Ramayana, it is Rama, God the Father, and Sita, who is the soul/the Holy Spirit, who goes into exile at some point, captured by the demonic forces. And then you have the Son, Hanuman, who is a monkey god. Very odd, why would they choose a monkey god to represent the Son? And it&#8217;s because the human being in the state of ego-consciousness is a monkey: its monkey mind is always chattering, its interests are mainly in food and sex, and it is wild and will not come under discipline. So the monkey is a wonderful metaphor. And yet this monkey, Hanuman, becomes divine. . . . It is said that God stands for G.O.D.: Generation, Operation, Destruction. . . . And we are now at a point where our current world cannot be sustained any longer because of the lack of love.&#8221;",

Regardless of our theory of the proximate cause of the holocaust in that lovely island, the karmic trajectory of mass excarnation of human souls is clear for all to see. By awakening to this reality, we can come to recognize the blessing of returning to God and bringing the world’s suffering to an end. If we have the faith and love of God as our primary orientation, our soul can be liberated even while the body is still alive. Let us offer a prayer for the souls on Maui to take refuge with the Lord of Eternal Light and Life. And may all the souls who have left their bodies be guided into the Divine Presence with the loving help of healing angels.",

Some teachers say there of course that there is no individual so just serve in order to (sometimes depending on the teacher) get away with violating the other in some way. While in fact there is no individual, there can&#8217;t be said to be a community either as far as the Absolute. So must both individual and community be honored yet balanced, as far as the world of relativity goes, this day in age?",
