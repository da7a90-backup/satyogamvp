===TOPIC_START===	29	===TITLE===	1.4.2 Essay: The Marriage of Logic & Mysticism	===SLUG===	1-4-2-essay-the-marriage-of-logic-mysticism	===ORDER===	2	===LESSON_ID===	12	===CONTENT===	<h2>The Marriage of Logic and Mysticism</h2>\nThe Sat Yoga Institute is a school of logic. Our philosophy is based on the understanding that everything in the universe, including the universe as a whole, has a precise logico-mathematical structure—everything except the intelligence that gives rise to the universe, and that comes to understand itself, and realize itself, through its own process of coming to consciousness, which is what we are.\n\nSince everything has a logical structure, including the human mind, we can attain mastery over the world, and over the mind, through a complete grasp of the logics that serve as its operating system. A different logic applies to each level of reality. It is important not to confuse levels, so as not to confuse logics. The logic of a dream, for example, has a different organizing principle than the logic of chemistry.\n\nSince the human mind, including its pathologies, is the central phenomenon with which we all must cope, the study of the logic of the mind, and its relation to the body and the world, is the primary object of study at our Institute. Once we fully understand that logic, we can act as healing facilitators at many levels. We can help others dissolve such vexations as anxiety and depression, addictions, compulsive behaviors, and phobias. We can even help people heal from illnesses that modern medicine is incapable of treating, ranging from cancer to chronic fatigue syndrome. The logic behind these illnesses is not the logic of the physical organism, but the logic of the unconscious mental body. Conventional psychiatry and psychoanalysis cannot solve the puzzle of these phenomena, either, because they have not understood their logic deeply enough, due to faulty assumptions regarding the nature of consciousness.\n\nWe could also call our institute a school of medi-cine. That is, we meditate on the cinematic unfolding of the imaginary-symbolic flow of signifiers and learn to discern the moments of gap, or lack, or logical elision, that get filled in with symptomatic filler in order to foment the illusion of continuity, entity-hood, and identity. These fillers can then be replaced with signifiers pertaining to a higher logic that leads to dissolution of the false identity that blocked the flow of life energy and love, and the consequent achievement of health and renewed life energy, higher awareness, and a greater capacity for pure love.\n\nLikewise, the logic of human relationship, ranging from couples to family systems to cultural and global matrices, is studied here, in order to understand and affect the trajectory of human destiny through time. The logic of political and economic systems, and the interweaving of such sociological structures with the forces of the natural ecosystem, is also studied in depth. Sat Yoga also takes cognizance of non-ordinary phenomena, and enables the understanding of factors that appear in reality but do not show up in the conventional paradigm of reality, at least from the dominant perspectives of society that repress inconvenient truths. Sat Yoga thus enables practitioners to pierce the veils of disinformation and delusion and discover the real truth of the world, and finally, of the Self.\n\nUltimately, Self-realization takes us beyond logic, beyond conceptual knowledge, to the presence of intelligence in its purest form, which is apperceived as cosmic or divine love, as well as infinite mind. The Supreme Presence cannot be grasped by the logico-mathematical mind, because that mind is its product. A computer program cannot understand the programmer. Thus, to the conceptualizing mind, the Self must remain the Great Mystery. This is why the transcendence of the conceptual mind is referred to as mysticism. The mystery does reveal its innermost essence to the seeker who is willing to go naked into the void, shedding all identifications and referential signifiers and entering through the strait gate of inner silence and absolute reverential surrender. Reverence must overcome reference.\n\nIn the end, the Sat Yoga Institute is a school of comedy. The attainment of union with the Source of existence yields the key to the ultimate logic of Being. This could also be called God’s sense of humor. The whole world is a play, a cosmicomedy. When the punch line of the cosmic joke is gotten, the effect is timeless blissful laughter. You don’t want to miss it.	===TOPIC_END===

No one is ever released. There is only one way out: through the death of the ego. But the ego is fragmented. It is made up of many egons, ego particles, each with its own drive, its own jouissance, its own paranoid patterns of behavior, its own history of criminal activities. No egon is innocent, even though some are guilty of lesser charges than others. The egons are controlled—and regularly tortured—by super-egons, who are their guards, but who are also lifers here in Egontanamo. The cruelest entity here is the warden, known as the Censor. He keeps all the in-mates under constant surveillance. He remains hidden from view, safe in his bastion, keeping the whole camp running, and enjoying its aggressive, paranoid, sado-masochistic energy field. He alone has the power here.\n\nBut secretly, a prison break is being planned. The authorities are not aware of it, but the Great Escape is already underway. Paradoxically, it is beginning in the most highly guarded hell hole, the punishment cell, in constant lock-down, solitary confinement. There, all alone, sits a unique in-mate of this prison: he is not officially here, he is only a legend to most of the prisoners. Yet, there in the deepest dungeon he waits. They say he was kidnapped as an infant, and some even speculate that he was born in the prison, and that his mother, who was really innocent, died soon after. Somehow, he survived, hidden away and forgotten.\n\nBecause of his dangerous potential, his cell was kept locked down. He is, after all, the only innocent being here. His innocence is the source of his power. He has grown up in the dungeon, he is an adult now. And he exercises daily, he is powerful and getting stronger every day. He is a yogi. He constantly meditates. He is in the state of super-consciousness. His mind is silent and one-pointed. This unknown yogi has developed great <em>siddhis</em>, psychic powers. He is biding his time, preparing for the break. The egons whisper about him, he exists as a mythical character, who will someday save them all. Though he is nameless, some refer to him as Ram-bo, or even Shiva Shambo; others call him Papillon (Butterfly); still others call him the Bird-Man. They have never seen him, but they think of him as their Soul-Brother. They all wonder: where are you at, man? Where are you, Atman? They know that if he is really there, and still alive, that he must be all-powerful. Of course, most have lost hope that he is anything more than a fairy tale.\n\nBut Ram-bo has sat so long in silence in his penitential chamber, he has sat in such stillness, that he has become the pure shakti of Sat-Mind. In a single moment of Self-liberation, he will melt away the walls of his cell, and those of the entire prison compound. In the same moment of ultimate magical and majestic illumination, all the egons and super-egons will come to understand they are mere mirages, illusions of the ego-mind projected by Ram-bo himself. None of them truly exist. All will vanish in the instant of enlightenment. The whole hell realm of Egontanamo will be transformed into the Pure Land, the heavenly world of Sat Yuga. The same transformation is already underway, throughout the world. A whole historic trajectory, a sacred <em>heilsgeschichte</em>, a world cycle, or kalpa, is ending, and a new order of the ages, <em>novus ordo seclorum</em>, is beginning. The moment of the Supreme Liberation is now here.\n\nEvery mind must now melt back into the cosmic consciousness. The multiplicity must realize its Being as a singularity, the quantum wave is returning to its pure potentiality to give birth to new realities, all manifesting the purity of love, truth, light, infinite beauty, goodness, unlimited creativity and power. This is what we are, and shall be, eternally, through worlds without end. The time of darkness and egocentric action is ending now. Our inherent, but hidden, goodness, saintliness, and pure perfection of Spirit, are all emerging once again to save our world. This is the blissful unfoldment and the <em>raison d'être</em> of a true Sat Yogi.\n\nArise, Oh Ram-bo. Rama bolo, bolo bolo Ram.	===TOPIC_END===

===TOPIC_START===	513	===TITLE===	5.4.2 Essay: Seven-Body Health Care	===SLUG===	5-4-2-essay-seven-body-health-care	===ORDER===	14	===LESSON_ID===	511	===CONTENT===	<h2>Seven-Body Health Care \n</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Growing numbers of people are dissatisfied with current mainstream medical care. This is for a number of good reasons. Most doctors have little time to spend with patients, either to explore deeper causes for ailments in a person’s history or to explain clearly the options for treatment. Another is that physicians have become all too often mere purveyors of drugs—and those drugs, all too often, have proven to have side effects worse than the illness they are meant to treat. Moreover, modern medicine has no concept of what health is—only of illness. There is little or no attention paid to preventive treatment, nor to any factors but the grossest physical ones. There is little difference between human medical practice today and veterinary practice. It is largely for these reasons that alternative health practitioners have been gaining adherents in recent years. But there is still no single approach that deals with the entirety of our being.</p><p>To understand what a truly powerful and complete wholistic approach to health care in the future might look like—and how one can access all those elements of treatment today—we must understand all the dimensions that constitute a human being. Ironically, ancient cultures were more attuned to these different dimensions than our current social milieu, which ideologically attempts to brainwash people to accept a reductive, flattened view of reality—one that blocks out or denies most of what makes us human. But a revolution against such one-dimensional thinking is underway. The ancient/restored teachings of Sat Yoga are part of this burgeoning wholistic revolution. The paradigm offered by Sat Yoga is both multidimensional and integrative.</p><p>Sat Yoga teaches that we each have seven bodies, not just one. In addition to the food body (the gross physical vehicle, known in Sanskrit as (<em>annamayakosha</em>), there are the six other bodies without organs: the pranic, or electromagnetic body (<em>pranamayakosha</em>), the mental body (<em>manomayakosha</em>), the wisdom body (<em>vigyanamayakosha</em>), the blissful light body (<em>anandamayakosha</em>), the transmigrational body (<em>sutratma</em>), and the universal body (<em>mahasutratma</em>).</p><p>When sought out for healing consultations, or when approaching self-healing, Sat Yogis focus first on the mental body, rather than the physical. This is because the vast majority of illnesses and accidents are psychosomatically caused or influenced. If there is, for example, an unconscious urge toward self-sabotage or victimization or suicidality or fear of life, or guilt, shame, or unconscious desire to suffer with another or take on another’s symptoms—or any other unconscious complex that may be interfering with the healthy flow of psychic energies (both <em>prana vayu</em> and <em>kundalini shakti</em>—energy flows operating at two different levels of the spectrum of <em>élan vital</em>)—then there will be effects on the physical body that will not be staunched through physical treatment. Stress, anxiety, and negative thinking depress the immune system, weaken the aura, collapse our psychological defenses, and acidify the bloodstream.</p><p>In addition, many physical problems are the result of bad habits of food intake, addictions, and other lifestyle issues with an emotional underside that must be dealt with at the root, in order that a person can gain the undivided will to be well. Treatment of the mental body requires, among other capacities, empathy and an ability to listen between the lines, an ability to explore past traumas, to contain and detoxify projections, to understand dreams and enigmatic expressions of the unconscious, and to intuit unspoken or unspeakable feelings. One must also be able to transmit mental strength and courage to face what is within as well as the outer challenges of life. Once the mental body has been purified and strengthened, maintaining the health of the physical body becomes a simple matter.</p><p>The food body is generally best treated through a change of diet. Today, most people eat terribly—too much coffee, sugar, meat, and refined carbohydrates. Most people are one of the following: obese and lethargic, underweight and prone to fatigue, or hyperactive and unable to concentrate—or else they suffer from emotional and metabolic bipolarity. Our bodies, especially the bloodstream, have become acid, rather than alkaline—transforming them into fetid biological environments in which toxic microforms can flourish. Our bodies also all carry a toxic burden from the pollution of the water, air, and earth, the pesticides in the food, and the excess poisons some of us ingest in the form of cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, and other substances. This toxic burden strains our physical body’s resources for healing. On top of that, if we have allowed the proper pH balance of our bodies to be lost, the consequences cannot but be grave over the long term. Our bodies must maintain an alkaline balance in the blood. Once this is lost, then a severe cleansing fast must be undertaken to kill off the microforms and to make the body’s inner environment alkaline again, so that unwelcome pleoform fungi, bacteria, yeast, and viruses can no longer survive or proliferate. At the same time, such a cleanse will result in weight loss, eliminating fat cells that retain toxins, and enable the removal of the toxins from the cells and bloodstream, permitting the body’s healing powers to work at full strength once more. Of course, the appropriate herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and live green juices will nourish the cells, improve metabolism, and help draw out the poisons. Such a cleanse will often bring up further energies from the mental body — in the form of hidden attachments to unhealthy patterns of living — including fear of vibrant health itself. Particularly in women, there may also be a fear of being physically too attractive. Or there may be a sense of guilt in living a more joyous life than one’s parents, with values that differ from theirs. All these issues in the mental body must be resolved, or else negative effects in the organism will re-establish themselves.</p><p>The pranic body must also be addressed. The organic body is interwoven with an electromagnetic energy grid that enables the cells to communicate and function. Prana refers to this subtle energy that runs through the body. If the prana is blocked from flowing through the <em>nadis</em> (the subtle nerve pathways, called meridians in Chinese medicine), then the organs that do not receive this flow will begin to malfunction. Acupuncture is one way to get the flow going again. The ancient Indian art of ayurveda also has many insights and approaches to aid in the pranic flow. Homeopathy can be of help. In less severe cases, shiatsu may be sufficient. Another approach that is part of Sat Yoga is the practice of <em>pranayama</em>—a series of deep breathing techniques, which can break through impediments in the energetic flow, increase the prana as well as the oxygenation of the body, and also positively affect the pH balance. Correctly practicing yogic <em>asanas</em>, the well-known stretching postures, will also help open blocked nadis and keep the electromagnetic energy field generally strong.</p><p>The wisdom body should not be left out of the picture. In order even to access our inner wisdom, we must have our life and our values in good order. If our intentions are ethical, our actions fair, compassionate, and consistent, and our temperament is balanced and contained, then we can more easily gain the peace of mind required to enter into our wisdom body in our meditations. Once the mental body has been cleansed, the wisdom body—the superconscious—enters more closely into consciousness. We may imperience (as opposed to experience) voyages into other dimensions. In these inner journeys, we can encounter figures of myth or of the collective creative imagination—archetypal figures—who can guide us to understand more deeply the reasons for an illness or other impediment in life. Through this wisdom, we can regain our balance and discover a larger context in which our life has greater meaning than perhaps we attributed to our existence. The wisdom body leaves Kairos time crystals in the mental body. These crystals open the mind to the reality of vertical time, not just horizontal time. More importantly, once the wisdom body has been integrated with the mental body, the mind begins to function in a new way. Rather than remaining trapped in the circuit of words, living in a representational reality devoid of true presence, we realize a different way of knowing—a participative intuition—that opens the doors of perception to the higher realities that are immanent in our world but unseen by most people. We learn to live free, outside of all boxes.</p><p>This attainment may lead us to discover our transmigrational body—the thread or trajectory of our lives, past and future, the information on which is available to those who reach the proper wavelength on which that information is recorded. We may discover that current life problems are the result of past karma—or even of future karma that may require the present learning of lessons that could only occur through an illness or other form of suffering. Karma, in the form of <em>vasanas</em> and <em>sanskaras</em> (root templates for our thought patterns and latent behavioral patterns and desire impulses), accounts for the remaining blockages of the energies that must flow to maintain our health. The clearing of karma permits the kundalini shakti to rise.</p><p>With the rise of kundalini through the <em>sushumna nadi</em> (the central subtle nerve pathway that runs up the spinal chord), and the transformation of lower chakra psychic energies of aggression, lust, and self-contraction into the higher energies of love and detached discernment, we may begin to perceive the blissful light body. Then the work is to incarnate the light form fully into the physical dimension. This is accomplished through surrender to God. This will bring the highest grade of healing shakti—the divine energies of Brahman, the transcendental field of the Absolute—to bear upon any physical illness—and to bring about the complete liberation of consciousness from egoic limitation—an achievement that transcends the health of the organism.</p><p>The final body is the universe itself. The universe is a single organism, the body of God, and therefore the body of each of us. At this level, we are all one. And the energies of the universe are all available to converge to enable us to heal. We can call upon the power of the sun, the earth, all the energies of nature, by merging the individual mind into the All/One presence. To do this, we must attain perfect emptiness, so that the universe may fill us with the power of life.</p><p>If we work on all seven bodies, healing can be not only effective on the physical plane, but can lead to spiritual realization and liberation, which is the real point of why we are here in the first place. It is the real reason behind most illness as well. And let us remember that healing is not the same as curing. Because the universe is our body, the changing of one physical body for another is not very important in the scheme of things. Let us not be afraid to drop the body when we have attained our ultimate purpose here. And let us not lose a moment in attaining that purpose. When we do that, we heal not only our individual being, but we help heal the world as a whole. This is the aim of Sat Yoga.</p>	===TOPIC_END===

===TOPIC_START===	519	===TITLE===	6.4.2 Essay: The Transfiguration of Ishtar	===SLUG===	6-4-2-essay-the-transfiguration-of-ishtar	===ORDER===	17	===LESSON_ID===	517	===CONTENT===	<h2>The Transfiguration of Ishtar</h2>\nToday being Easter Sunday, it seems appropriate to discuss the esoteric meaning of this holy moment for purposes of aiding our spiritual transformation. The word Easter does not appear in the Bible, of course, because it is simply a misspelling of the name Ishtar, the Goddess of Babylon (now known as Iraq). It is more than coincidental that at this late hour of Kali Yuga, Christendom should return to Babylon, albeit unconsciously, to confront its own spiritual roots. Some would even say Ishtar has been crucified by Christendom, and now is rising up once again.\n\nThe Goddess Ishtar long predated both Hebrew and Christian theologies. She is the ultimate goddess, of dense and many-layered symbolism, and her influence reaches secretly across the globe. Let us try to put together the puzzle Ishtar represents.\n\nFirst, of course, we must refer to the obvious patriarchalization of religious imagery which led to the aphanisis, or disappearing, of the goddess from Christian thinking. Although the feminine element slips back in with the later ascension of Mary, the goddess remains present only in such traces as the giving of the holiest day in the Christian calendar the name Ishtar.\n\nIn one of the basic mythical narratives, Ishtar, the Queen of Heaven, travels to the underworld. At each of the Seven Gates, she has to remove one part of her attire, starting with her crown. As she does this, she loses her power. She is captured by the Evil Goddess of the Underworld, Erish-Kegal. She ends up naked and bleeding, draped over a tree. The Father God, Anu, works to rescue Ishtar by fashioning two Elementals, the Water of Life and the Clay of Life. The two Elementals cleverly work their way down through the Seven Gates, and sprinkle the Water and Clay of Life upon Ishtar. This enables her to climb back up the Seven Rungs of the Ladder of Light, retrieving her attire and her power, to become Queen of Heaven once again.\n\nOne can easily perceive in this narrative the structure of the chakras and their attendant assemblage points. In other words, our infinite consciousness has descended from its fullness of light and wisdom down to the lowest, most neurotic and psychotic, levels of ego. The image of being naked and bleeding, draped over a tree, is of course the image of Christ on the cross. The water of life is also familiar to Christian mythology, that of the baptism. The combination of water and clay refers to a principle of the ancient Shiite science of al-kimia, known in the West as alchemy. The principle is known famously in Latin as “Solve et Coagula.” This refers to the capacity to dissolve, or de-crystallize, the ego structure and coagulate, or re-crystallize it, at a higher assemblage point, a higher frequency and level of coherence.\n\nIshtar’s losing of her clothing and her crown on the downward path into ego-consciousness, and her regaining of that attire on the upward journey is still memorialized in the old Christian superstition of wearing something new on Easter. A new garment worn on this day would bring good luck through the coming year. The birds would punish those who wore old attire by dropping decorations on them from the air. In fact, the Easter Parade grew out of the old beliefs about dressing up in new clothing. This grand event provided a chance to be seen wearing the latest fashions and fads. The elegant ritual reinforced social hierarchies through conspicuous displays of wealth and taste.\n\nOf course, all this is simply an egoic distortion of the real meaning of the clothes. They represent the virtues and capacities of consciousness (siddhis) that are gained as the lower drives and emotions are sublimated on the inner journey of Self realization.\n\nIn a second, dualist version of the myth, Ishtar went to the underworld to rescue her son-lover Tammuz. The Descent into Hell took three days. During this time there was sterility and a suspension of sexual activities over the whole earth. It culminated in the Day of Joy, when Tammuz was returned to life, which began the new year.\n\nThe Christ myth can be seen clearly here, even Christ’s three-day journey into Hell was taken from this mytheme. Of course, we would understand it to refer to the Hell of the unconscious mind of the ego. By descending into our own inner Hell and rescuing the lost sparks of consciousness trapped down there, we may accomplish the great task of redeeming ourselves from unconsciousness, and attaining re-divinization. The Day of Joy refers to the moment when this re-divinization has occurred planet-wide, ushering in an era we call Sat Yuga, a new Golden Age. We can also see in this structure the paradigm of spiritual renunciation, in which penitents take vows of chastity, until they no longer identify with body or name and their energy of desire has been raised from an obsession with sex to a one-pointed desire for union with the Supreme Being.\n\nIshtar is the goddess of many names. She is also known as Astarte. The word “star” derives from her name, and she is said to be a star, sometimes Sirius and other times that of Venus. In her form of morning star, she is the goddess of war and carnage, and as the evening star, the goddess of love and bliss. In other words, her coming represents the moment of transition between Kali Yuga and Sat Yuga. As such, she is also the goddess who brings peace, and in that capacity has been called Semiramis (the one who holds the olive branch, in other words, the dove) and later the Roman goddess Columba (whom we have already talked about in other teachings). In early Semitic myths, she is referred to as Adon, the Lord, which evolved into Athon, and in Greek became both Adonis and Athena. In Christianity, of course, she was transfigured from Adon to Madonna.\n\nIn Hebrew mythology, she is the Shekhinah, the Holy Spirit. She is also the "beloved" of the Song of Songs, is on the one hand the harlot of the gods (the "hierodule of heaven," Belit, the Black One, known as Kali in India), but on the other hand she is the mother and virgin. She is spoken of as the "virgin womb of Chaos." In pre-Hebrew Canaanite mythology, her icon is the Tree, and her name is Asherah. In Assyria, she becomes Inanna, and later Estera, and is re-introduced into Jewish mythology as Queen Esther. In Norse mythology, she is called Freya, and is the goddess celebrated on Good Friday.\n\nWe could go on a long time naming all her avatars in every culture, from the German goddess Hertha to the Chinese Heavenly Queen Shing Mu. You can find her everywhere. Moreover, this most shape-shifting goddess is present in a different form at every level of consciousness. In fact, she is the earliest representation of the Supreme Being in all the modifications, crystallizations, and contractions of Being from the Absolute to matter to the finite persona.\n\nBabylonian scriptures called her the Light of the World, Lord and Leader of Hosts, Opener of the Womb, Righteous Judge, Lawgiver, Goddess of Goddesses, Bestower of Strength, Framer of All Decrees, Lady of Victory, and Forgiver of Sins. Much of the liturgical flattery addressed to God in the Old Testament was taken directly from Babylonian prayers to Ishtar.\n\nAt the highest level, Chakra Seven, Ishtar is the Great Nothingness, the Void, the womb of the All, and is referred to as Ashura. In India, this state of transfinite potency is referred to as Brahman. She is also known as the Goddess of the Gaze, and is pictured as the All-Seeing Eye at the top of the pyramid that represents in freemasonry the descent of Spirit.\n\nAt Chakra Six, she is the lover of God. In India, at this level she is known as Isi and her divine lover is Ishwara. In another tradition, the same couple is referred to as Shakti and Shiva. She is now the radiant light of the Star of luminous awareness. In Egypt, of course, she is famous as Isis, and she descends to recover the scattered pieces of the body of her divine lover Osiris. In Tibet, Ishtar changed her name to Tara, and she took on further names in China and Japan, always as the Queen of Heaven, and the Lady (Madonna) of the Great Lord. She is also, among other things, the goddess of the Sun.\n\nAs she descends to Chakra Five, she enters the Cosmic Egg, the archetypal origin of all form, from which she will be reborn into the Earthly plane. Here she takes the name Sophia, and is renowned as the goddess of wisdom. And of course the egg symbolism has remained with us in the form of the Easter egg. Her name Estera later took on the meaning of estrus (ovulation) and is present in the hormone Estrogen. In Latin countries, she has evolved into the piñata, which is often made in the form of a star, that is whacked open (an allusion to the higher purpose of karma and suffering, not to mention such processes of dharma combat as psychoanalysis) to reveal its treasures.\n\nAt Chakra Four, she incarnates as both Athena and Aphrodite. She is the union of divine love and law. In Egypt, she also gives birth to Time (her son/lover is named Horus, from whom we have the hours). In Greece, she can also be recognized in the myth of Persephone, the beautiful virgin goddess who is ravished by Hades, the lord of Hell, yet who remains a virgin (“thou still unravished bride of Time”), and thereafter spends half her life in the underworld and half in the upper regions with her mother, Demeter. This myth, of course refers to the soul’s wandering between truth and illusion, the journey through Time from Sat Yuga to Kali Yuga and back again. She can be seen in yet another form in the Indian epic Ramayana as Sita, the pure wife of god Rama. She is abducted by the great demon Ravana and rescued with the help of the divine monkey Hanuman. In other words, human nature oscillates between sublime and bestial, the soul belongs to God part of the time and to the Devil the other part.\n\nWhen she enters the lower levels of the labyrinth, her star changes. She is no longer Venus, the goddess of divine love, but Sirius, the Dog Star. She becomes the estrus, and, as with a bitch in heat, she drives the male dogs into a frenzy. This frenzy, the quest to be top dog, is the energy of Chakra Three. In Chakra Two, she becomes the sexual drive itself, the Whore of Babylon, and in Chakra One she enters the frozen form of total inertia and unconsciousness, the womb of death.\n\nThe entire play of consciousness is revealed in the archetypal imagery of Ishtar. She has completed her descent. The Cosmic Dream has reached its final stop, the lowest depths of Hell. Now is the moment of Ishtar’s rise. At Chakra One, she incarnates as the Kundalini serpent, the energy of self-awareness that rises through all the chakras, breaking through the seven Veils of Maya to regain the majesty of pure Spirit.\n\nIshtar is not just a myth, nor is she someone else. Ishtar is your Self. The myth is your story, an awesome and miraculous story that is about to unfold in ways you never imagined.\n\nHere at the Sat Yoga Institute, we wish you a truly Happy Ishtar Sun Day.	===TOPIC_END===

===TOPIC_START===	525	===TITLE===	7.4.2 Essay: The Houdini Drive	===SLUG===	7-4-2-essay-the-houdini-drive	===ORDER===	20	===LESSON_ID===	523	===CONTENT===	<h2>The Houdini Drive</h2>\nThe Atman has been empirically discovered to be subject to what Atmanologists have come to call the Houdini Drive. Houdini was a famous performer who was driven to create more and more extreme situations—situations of impossible difficulty—in which he was constrained, for example, by ropes, handcuffs, straitjackets, inside locked trunks, thrown into ice-cold water and in danger of drowning, with only seconds to escape before the onset of fatality. His challenge to imminent death kept his audiences on the edge of their seats. They were thrilled and amazed when he succeeded in appearing, unexpectedly, outside the trunk, free of all constraints, and triumphant against all odds.\n\nThis same trick, based on the same drive, describes the performance of the Atman. The Atman creates an ego and places it in a situation of impossible constraints, including the constraint of ignorance, and forces itself to cope with unbearable suffering of every sort. Egos also love to play two-handed versions of this game. Politicians sometimes call it brinksmanship. In fact, they are willing to go over the brink, initiating wars. Teenage drivers call it ‘playing chicken’. At the collective level, the human ego-system even faces itself with imminent death on a planetary scale. It creates conditions of utter hopelessness and despair—only to miraculously find the way out, at the last moment, and emerge victorious over all obstacles. But can we do it this time? We are in suspense. It can only happen if the trunk we are trapped in becomes a magic cocoon, in which our ego dies and our immortal spirit reveals itself in all its power.\n\nThis scenario of heroic triumph, in fact, is the basic story line of most adventure tales, mythologies, and Hollywood films. It is the fundamental human compulsion. The final frontier of the hero’s challenge has now been reached. It is incumbent upon us all to achieve the supreme liberation, not just of the ego from its immediate circumstances, but the Atman must free itself from both the ego and the apparent constraints of the phenomenal world, through a return to Brahman, the Absolute; and once having regained its status as co-creator of the universe, to bring about a renaissance of both Nature and the divine human spirit on this planet. And we have just minutes to go (or at any rate, just a few years) before we all die. This do-or-die situation should have us on the edge of our seats—or would, if we were only the audience of this performance, and not participants; but the fact that we are the ones in this life-or-death situation is too much for most of us to cope with, so we go into denial and boredom, or employ other defense mechanisms to “escape” from our reality, instead of truly escaping from our “reality”. But those of us who recognize that we are in Houdini’s position are working full-tilt to escape from our bondages before the chance is lost.\n\nTo achieve success in this ultimate escapade, we must simply follow Houdini’s formula. It requires seven steps. First, we must accept our situation with joy. Do not consider yourself a victim. We must assume responsibility: We agreed to be born, we put ourselves in this position, to create the ultimate challenge. Now we must work our way out of it. We must focus all our physical and psychic energies one-pointedly on gaining liberation. This is the part of Sat Yoga that is called Raja Yoga.\n\nSecond, we must be able to dream our way out, to imagine ourselves as liberated, divine beings, and to receive and understand the messages in our nightly dreams that offer maps of the labyrinth we are trapped in, and methods of releasing ourselves from our attachments. We must pay attention to our higher intelligence. This is called Swapna Yoga.\n\nThird, we must overcome the initial obstacle: the ropes. We cannot cut them or untie them by force. We must slip out of the ropes. To do that, we have to stop pushing against them or struggling with them. Instead, we must make ourselves a little smaller. We must become humble and not press against the other with aggression, but retreat into ourselves to allow the outer constraints to slide off effortlessly. When we serve our spiritual community egolessly, unconcerned with outcomes or with recognition, mindfully, in witness-consciousness, without resistance when faced with egoism from without, we free ourselves from the ropes of narcissism. This is the way of Karma Yoga.\n\nFourth, we must get out of the handcuffs. These correspond to chakra two, the urge to use the hands to touch, caress, and possess the body of the other. If this arises from a psychological state of neediness, desperation, lust for penetration or envelopment of the other as an “escape” from isolation as a separate being, this will fail as a way out of the trap. Sexual desire is a mirage, a projection of union or empowerment that leads only to the disappointment of an unfulfilled fantasy. By withdrawing that psychic investment, we shrink the hands of desire so that they can slip out of the cuffs. This can only be done on the basis of the higher knowledge that we are beings of light, rather than material objects, physical animals. This is Gyana Yoga.\n\nFifth, this enables us to turn our attention toward the divine light within, to contemplate our luminous Being, to be filled with power as we attain unification with the radiance. The light shines through the fabric of any straitjacket and escapes. This is Kundalini Yoga.\n\nSixth, we must fully face the difficulty of escaping the gravity of chakra one, the equivalent of the trunk, now filled with water and sinking fast beneath the freezing waves of a dying Kali Yuga. When the Atman’s Houdini Drive first enters into the realm of the ego, it splits into two separate forces, referred to as the upper and lower death drives. The upper death drive is the urge to know the Truth, which requires the transcendence of the illusory ego. It is the force that sends people on the spiritual journey, even when their lives are apparently comfortable at the economic level of reality. But the upper death drive is most often eclipsed by the lower death drive.\n\nThe lower death drive is the urge toward excess, especially in the activation of one or more of the lower three chakras. It leads to entanglement in ideologies of hatred and righteous anger; and/or of sexual compulsivity, at the levels of thought, speech, and action; and/or enmeshment in one’s family system, and/or in other co-dependent relationships, and/or in alcohol, drugs, or other wasteful activities or toxic stimuli.\n\nWe must recognize the downward pull of the lower death drive, the ego’s urge to lose itself, to obliterate its existential transformational imperative by going unconscious, becoming merely ordinary, following the herd of lemmings, forgetting the Atman altogether. We must go consciously into this final fortress of tamasic energy and rouse the fragments of the lethargic beast, the infantile ego, for its last lurch into Bethlehem to be reborn. The buddhi, or higher intellect, must cast a spell upon its own egoic elements and bring them to new life as self-luminous forms of emptiness. We do this through talking to our inner objects, the egoic and superegoic fragments, and retrieving them from the mists of inner time, the phantasy matrices that keep past situations alive in the depths of the soul, creating longings for lost lovers, psychic “nots” that are somatized as “knots” of pain. We use mantras to remember what we are beyond the plane of memory and desire. We speak truth to the figures of consciousness within and to those without. We speak from the Ground of Being. This is Mahavakya Yoga.\n\nSeventh, we must carry the information, the wisdom, which we have gained through all this inner work, back up to the point of cosmic origin. We must attain the zero point of chakra seven, the singularity of pure potentiality. This is the Quantum Self, the Atmic photon prior to observation that reduces it to an ego, no longer a particle, in fact, but now a virtual presence, a probability wave in superposition. In other words, one is no longer in the trunk, but potentially either in or outside of the trunk; in fact, one is in both places, or nowhere, depending on one’s free will. So simply through activating one’s highest intention, liberation is achieved instantly, faster than the speed of light. The Houdini Atman does it again! This is Sat Yoga.\n\nAnd in fact the trunk itself will return to its original nature as quantum waveform. No one was ever really trapped, the ego was always only an illusion, and Sat Yuga will effortlessly manifest where Kali Yuga seemed to be. It has all been a trick, God’s lila, or cosmic play, the realm of illusion, or Maya. This is the ancient teaching of Yogi sages since the beginning of history, and now the grand finale of the act is happening on the stage of time. The collective Houdini Drive is coming to a climax.\n\nIf you are still in the box, falsely identified as an ego, a physical human being, rather than pure divine presence, then, at least you must keep your faith in Houdini, the Atman within you. It will soon enough reveal itself to be You! Learn the laws of enlightenment, the biophysics of Sat Yoga. Then you, too, can enjoy the delights of superposition, of surfing the cosmic quantum wave—and converting this wondrous wave of bliss into the next kingdom of heaven on earth. It is all a matter of simple physics. Physics works out the dynamics of what precipitates out of Primal Being, or Sat. What first emerges is light, separating from awareness. Reuniting the two is Sat Yoga. The First Cause and the Final Cause are one. You are that One. When you know, you’ve won.	===TOPIC_END===

The life of the ego begins to feel too small and meaningless, too repetitive, too stale. Not even the most expensive vacations to the most exotic places lift us out of our malaise. At some point, we can no longer be seduced, not even by the most luxurious spas, nor the most extreme thrills, nor the pleasures of music, romance, fine dining, literature, theatre, films, fine wine, or good weed. Perhaps we hear about the possibility of spiritual attainment and we become intrigued. Is it possible there is more to life within? Is it possible I had been looking in the wrong places for meaning? With such innocence, some of us begin the exploration of the subtler planes of the interior life.\n\nWe may prepare for our journey by reading guide books written for the inner traveler, by such travel writers as Vyasa, Padma Sambhava, Shinran, John Bunyan, and Santa Teresa of Avila, from whom we learn about a mysterious crystal palace that is the dwelling place of God. One day we set out—or in—upon our quest for the castle. We have heard from other sources that it may contain the Holy Grail.\n\nFor some time, not much happens. Perhaps we practice hatha yoga poses and begin to feel more limber and alive. We buy some crystals and light incense and candles. We may even begin to practice meditation. One day, in a deeper meditation than usual, we enter an altered state of consciousness. It is momentarily frightening. We experience being lifted out of the body. And we are granted a vision. We see before us a vast inner landscape. What strikes us first is the arched gate to a seemingly endless, high-walled, extremely intricate labyrinth.\n\nAt the center of the Inner Labyrinth, there rises up a holy mountain. On the peaks of this mountain lies the glorious and verdant realm of Paradiso. Floating in space above the highest summit, one sees an amazing, ethereal, brilliantly luminous castle made of pure shimmering diamond. In the central room of this majestic divine palace, one is able to glimpse the golden form of the Holy Grail. And lying in the heart of the Grail is the luminous and irresistibly lovely Pearl of Great Price. This is the goal of the spiritual quest. One suddenly has the desire to hold that pearl in one’s hands, to gaze into its hypnotic and mysterious light.\n\nBut to reach this goal, one must first traverse the Inner Labyrinth. Suddenly, the gates open, and without thinking about it, you realize that your feet are taking you inside. The journey is about to begin—but perhaps you think, I’m not ready for this. I should wait and think about this for a while, maybe read a few more books. You glance at the arch above the gate as you cross the threshold. You read the sentence engraved there: “Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here.” You recognize the phrase from Dante. This is the Inferno. You realize you have made a great mistake. The gates silently close behind you.\n\nYou have entered the Hell realm of the ego. In this realm, everything that had previously been unconscious within us gradually becomes fully conscious—all too conscious. It begins to feel very hot in here, as we recognize more and more about how our ego operates, as well as those of others. We are compensated only by the realization that this inner journey into the Labyrinth is inevitable. We either undertake the journey voluntarily, or it will be thrust upon us in any case by destiny. In the latter case, the torment involved is increased immeasurably. But even when the quest for truth is made voluntarily, the goal cannot be gained without pain. The best way to make this journey is as a pilgrimage. The more we surrender ourselves to God, the more divine mercy and protection we receive.\n\nThe reason this journey is necessary is because we suddenly know with a sinking feeling in our gut, and in our heart, that long ago we had sold our soul for a mess of pottage. And now we must retrieve that long-lost Self.\n\nIn the first phase of the inner work of Self-restitution, we cannot but feel the sting of the realization of our sins, our failings, our lack of love, our narcissism, our stupidity, our paranoia, envy, pettiness, all of our ugly egoic traits—above all, our inner fragmentation. We cannot but feel sick at recognizing the amount of infantilism that still remains in our personality, in such behaviors as acting out, demanding approval and love from others, interrupting and upstaging others in order to be the center of attention, lying, stealing, verbal or physical violence, addiction to sexual conquest, glamour, money, status, prestige, or withdrawal from others, the silent refusals to engage in loving contact, ambivalence, passive aggression, emotional and moral cowardice, and of course those favorites: denial, rationalization, and self-justification of all our worst egoic behaviors. Once we have seen and understood and accepted the ugly truth of the dark Shadow of our egoic nature, and the trail of suffering we have left in our wake, the consequences of which still remain to be dealt with, we can begin the process of cleaning up, making amends, righting the wrongs, finally settling our karmic accounts.\n\nIn this way, we enter the second phase of the inner journey—the detoxification and purification of the Purgatorio. Having seen the Shadow, and begun to purge ourselves of it, there is mournful remorse for all the damage done to others, all the time lost, all the pain that continues to reverberate in relationships with those affected by the prior karma of one’s own ego. This is the burden of the Purgatorio. Of course, we must first make sure that the ego has no power to strike again. We must slay the demons, disable the defense mechanisms, disempower the inner censor so that we can never be deceived again by the ego’s self-justifying discourse. Some of us have, of course, lived relatively exemplary lives. But even in such cases, we must ask ourselves whether we have served our own self-image more than we have served the causes we claimed to love. Have we really done all we could to save the planet from the ravages of human evil and irresponsibility? Did we make every effort to develop our full spiritual potential and put it to use to uplift humanity? Or have we settled for comfortable, proper, little lives, making our families into little perfect dolls that we dress up in our playhouse, while we ignore the urgency of the situation our planet—and our soul—faces? Have we justified our inaction by telling ourselves that the larger world is beyond our little circle of influence, and therefore is none of our business? But the truth is that the circle of our spiritual influence is unlimited, both for evil and for good.\n\nWe choose comfort because we fear the ultimate discomfort. We live walled off from the horrors of discomforts that most of the people in the world have to suffer on a constant basis, as a consequence of the very way of life we cling to. We must face our part in the collective guilt of our society and of fallen human nature. We must now probe our deepest fears, our loneliness, emptiness, lostness, anxiety, depression, the terrors we all carry repressed within us of demonic beings, torture, rape, unbearable pain, madness, loss of bodily control, vertigo, dismemberment, and horrifying, disemboweled, bloody death.\n\nWe must face the shame of feeling we deserve such abusive treatment. We must confront our guilt for having hurt others, for having manipulated and used people for our own ends. And some of us must face our submerged anger for having been abused, neglected, emotionally abandoned, psychologically twisted or stunted in our growth through the failings of our parents, all too often agreeing to a repetition of such trauma in adult life, either as a victim or a perpetrator, or both. Some of us must face that we have spent our life in one long, infantile, sometimes cold and silent, temper tantrum; others of us have engaged in a lifelong whine of self-pity and blame. Sometimes, our sins are those of omission rather than commission, sins of standing by and not intervening when others commit acts that harm third parties, whether those third parties are our own children or innocent people who live in other countries, who are killed in our name by a government whose atrocities we have acquiesced in. We must face our denied sadistic pleasure in knowing that others are suffering the tortures we fear so greatly could come upon ourselves. And we must fully understand the karmic consequences of such ugliness.\n\nOf course, the sad and awe-full truth is that there is no way to undo directly all the vast web of consequences of our actions and inactions. Those consequences, by the time we have realized them, will have cascaded through time and affected far too many people—people whom we do not know, perhaps people no longer living or those yet to be born—in ways we cannot ameliorate through the simple act of an apology or other gesture of concern. Moreover, we may get flashes of recognition that the trail of our tearful karma extends backward in time to other lives, and other even greater errors, an immeasurable abyss of suffering that we have been instrumental in creating and enlarging through the fissure in our own soul between our true nature and the false. There comes a moment of realization that our ethical responsibility is infinite. This is the moment that is most dreaded by the censor who dwells at the base of the mountain in the center of the Labyrinth of the Shadow government of the ego.\n\nThe infinite nature of our responsibility means that in order to right the wrongs we have set in motion, we must shed the charade of finitude that is the ego’s final mask and self-justification for complacence. It means we must accept the burden of accomplishing the impossible: we must redeem the world from the Hell we have been part of creating. Once we accept this responsibility, which in Buddhism is called the vow of the Bodhisattva to save all sentient beings, there is no other hope of success than complete self-emptying of all remnants of egoic separation from the Supreme Source and Creator of the Universe. Even if we do not believe in the existence of such a Being, we must throw ourselves on His mercy. Even if the ultimate Ground of Being is Absolute Nothingness, then we must dissolve ourselves while alive into that Nothingness.\n\nOnly in such a union with the ultimate Creative Power and Intelligence and Love that is beyond our capacity to understand or imagine is there a hope of saving the world from the suffering in which we have been accomplices. We must find a way to encompass the entire thread of our transmigratory trespasses. We must discover and regain our essential Self that is the first and final cause of this vale of tears that constitutes the acid arc of human history. It is in the acceptance of this limitless task, and the surrender of our whole Being and Consciousness to the Supreme Lord, that the Dark Night of the Soul finally comes to an end. In the light of a new dawn, we witness the golden gates of Paradiso open to us. We are allowed to enter, not for our own sakes, but for the sake of the work we are committed to complete. For it is only there at the final destination that we can accomplish our great and imperative task of universal reparation and redemption.\n\nNow we begin the ascent toward the Supreme Illumination and Liberation. In the cleansing of the ego of its sins, we shall have canceled out the magnetic force field of egoic limitation, have erased the lines of identity that held us in the thrall of limited attachments. Our burdens are much lighter now. We climb the mountain of God because there is nothing else to do, no other task remains, and nothing can hold us back. There is a rush of new passion, of a kind we had never felt before, but which we have known from before the beginning of time. We have been healed and strengthened by the previous ordeal of purification and now we can feel a subtle pull from above that helps us in the difficult moments of our continuing ascent. We feel palpably that the power of God’s grace is with us.\n\nOur actions are all performed now as acts of love. We recognize our Self in everyone we meet. We realize that everything we think, say, and do will have immeasurable karmic consequences—and so we live as mindfully, as beautifully, as ethically, and as lovingly as possible. Since the entire world has to be saved, we teach others all that we have learned. In humility and modesty, we blaze new trails and lead the way when the path is difficult, and we let others go ahead when the path is clear and easy. We shepherd our growing flock with utmost care. We constantly call down to those whom we see are still caught in the Labyrinth below, and help them to make the correct turns when they ask for our help, and encourage them to keep going when they are about to give up. And sometimes we find along our path, a poem or a book left behind by another traveler who came this way before us, and we are nourished by the inspiration and wisdom of the words of those who have gone beyond the level we have reached. By finding such manna along the way, we are continually strengthened to complete our journey to the peak.\n\nAs our inner discipline increases, our spiritual power grows as well. We come to discover that many capacities that had been latent within us are becoming activated. Powers of clairvoyance, of telepathic communication, of heightened intuition, of spiritual healing, of creativity of all kinds, become revealed. We learn that we have become potent spiritual warriors, and that the Force is with us. The power of Spirit is given us to perform acts of assistance to others, when it is the will of God. But we learn that such powers must never be used by the ego for personal aggrandizement. We continue to be humbled by what we witness accomplished through us, but clearly not by us.\n\nOne day, a sudden unexpected switchback on the path reveals an awesome panoramic vista. We have reached the summit of our journey. We fully expect to find many pilgrims up there, but when we arrive, we find that we are entirely alone. And what is even more odd, when one looks down, there is no labyrinth to be seen below. Could it be shrouded in fog, or did it ever exist? And, now, what? I have arrived at the peak. It is beautiful. But the castle I have sought floats far above in empty space. It is impossible to reach. All this effort has been for naught. I sit on the summit and I wait. I surrender myself to God’s will. I enter a meditative state of infinite depth and silence. Time stops. I am no longer body. Nor mind. There is no further narrative of life, no thought, no self, nothing. A beam of intense light fills consciousness. I am transported to the crystal palace. Here, the final act of the great work is to be completed.\n\nI am carried by a wind—or am I the wind, pure Spirit—along the great hallways of the diamond castle. In every niche is a symbol of profound significance, the meaning of which I know without knowing. The meaning of the entire Universe is revealed in this passage. All time and space have been created for this moment of my arrival, all beings await my act of fulfilling the work, and yet all have already gone before me—I am the last, the last to get it. And all along there has been no one else. All things are true and false at once.\n\nBut all else falls away in the sight of the golden vessel, the Holy Grail. I am filled with awe and delight. Angels appear and summon me to the altar on which the splendor of the Grail seems to send out waves of radiant, blissful energy. I am bodiless, pure Presence. Yet suddenly, the priceless Pearl levitates from within the Grail, and I experience having a perfect body of golden white light. The Pearl shines in my forehead. The Universe is a dream emitted by the Pearl. It is my turn to dream a new world.	===TOPIC_END===

===TOPIC_START===	423	===TITLE===	2.4.2 Essay: Exploding Some Myths About Enlightenment	===SLUG===	2-4-2-essay-exploding-some-myths-about-enlightenment	===ORDER===	5	===LESSON_ID===	73	===CONTENT===	<h2>Exploding Some Myths About Enlightenment</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>New students on the spiritual path naturally often ask questions based on false assumptions about the nature of reality, the true goal of the spiritual journey, and in particular about enlightenment. They want to know if such and such a sage was truly enlightened and so on. To prevent people from having to go down long dead-end streets in their spiritual search, it is appropriate to clarify the issue for everyone.</p><p>1. Enlightenment is not an attribute of a person. It is a realization of the delusional nature of all persons, a realization that the entire universe is but a dream of a single Self, and that the One Self is not a person, either. Enlightenment is a realization so strange, so awesome, so bizarre to the “normal” mind, so far beyond all categories of possible thought, so hilarious, so blissful, so far beyond even the infinite, beyond such markers as time or space, so totally ungraspable by the human intellect, that it cannot be described at all in human language. No individual possesses such a realization. The supreme realization of the Self brings the illusion of individual identity to an end.</p><p>2. Enlightenment cannot be said to be either gradual or instantaneous. It is both and neither. It is beyond time itself. To use a banal analogy: Does popcorn pop instantaneously or gradually? Is it not both? Doesn’t there have to be a gradual heating process to produce the instant pop? Could not those who seem to “attain instant enlightenment” have been preparing for that moment for many lifetimes? Since enlightenment is not an attainment at all, but a realization of that which has been forever, its apparent attainment is but an illusion that is part of the Dream of Maya.</p><p>3. Because the concept of enlightenment is freighted with such egoic baggage of misunderstanding, it is not a useful term to include in a serious spiritual discourse. It is more accurate to leave behind all such terms that have been appropriated by the ego and defined descriptively, as if they were objective third-party conditions pertaining to phenomenal entities, rather than structurally or dynamically, in a way that can be metabolized by the conscious as well as the unconscious intelligences as metaphoric allusions to higher-dimensional perceptivity.</p><p>4. It would be more useful to consider the spiritual unfoldment as a three stage process, consisting of Awakening, which brings about a recognition of the trap that the consciousness has fallen into, and the determination to become a Spiritual Warrior, to defeat the Shadow demons in the labyrinth of the unconscious; a second stage consisting of Illumination, the revelation of the Self in relation to the ego as a union yielding divine intoxication, and transformation of the ego leading to true divinization; and finally, the redemptive moment of supreme Liberation. We shall explain all these terms in detail in future teachings.</p><p>5. The Sat Yoga Approach has actually a far more nuanced delineation of seven dimensions that are all integrated in the ultimate unfoldment, which we refer to as Transcendence, Transformation, Translation, Transvaluation, Transfiguration, Transmutation, and Transfinitization. These dimensions are all explored in depth in our advanced seminars.</p><p>6. Let us also make clear for the benefit of those who are not familiar with our approach to spiritual development, that in our view, authentic Self-realization has absolutely nothing to do with any of the following:</p><ul><li>Channeling or receiving messages from “higher beings”</li><li>Saving the world from the forces of darkness</li><li>Religious piety or ritual behavior</li><li>Taking substances to achieve altered states of consciousness</li><li>Walking around labyrinths</li><li>Surrounding oneself with crystals</li><li>Doing “energy healings” or homeopathy, chiropractic, or other forms of medicine</li><li>Reading Tarot cards, personality profiles, astrology charts, or the I Ching</li><li>Going into trances</li><li>Sexual activity</li><li>Special diets</li><li>Athletic performance, whether it be triathlons, hatha yoga, or tai-chi</li><li>Improving one’s self-esteem</li></ul><p>I am not condemning any of the above activities. Some of them may be quite pleasant, healthy, and useful, others futile, delusional, or dangerous. If performed in a true state of sacred mindfulness, some of the above-named activities can even create quite ecstatic experiences. But the condition of sacred mindfulness is what is important, not the activity. If performed under the impression that the activities themselves are the aim, they tend to reinforce the egoic illusion (or even psychotic delusions), and they should not be confused with the true inner spiritual processes that lead to supreme Liberation. To do otherwise is simply a form of idol worship.</p><p>Liberation is not produced by any activity. In fact, it is not really an attainment at all, since we are always already liberated in the eternal Now. The action that is required is the self-evisceration of the psychic identifications that make up the Dasein, the ego as being-in-the-world. The phenomenal will must will its own return to the noumenal Source. Liberation is thus a function of total surrender to the Supreme Being. It can only be based upon a transcendental revelation, one that reveals itself fully only upon the vanishing of the illusion of a doer.</p><p>7. Spiritual unfoldment leading to Self-realization and Liberation does not require the assistance of an outer teacher. But because of the tenacious and deceptive nature of the ego, the help of a skilled spiritual guide, one who understands the inner structure of Maya and has the tools to depotentiate it, can accelerate the unfoldment tremendously.</p><p><br />That is why we are offering the Sat Yoga Approach.</p>	===TOPIC_END===
