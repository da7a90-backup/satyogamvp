It was deployed not only for wisdom but also for developing paranormal powers (siddhis). Yoga has served as the basis and engine of all religions, as well as the mystical, magical, and shamanic orders. In recent times, however, the term Yoga has been appropriated by the ego and has been diluted, commercialized, and too often diverted from its original purpose. Our approach returns to the ancient tradition of offering Darshan (direct transmission from the Source of Power), Diksha (initiation), Gyana (knowledge), and Sadhana (praxis). But we have re-engineered the process to enable you to reinforce your will power and courage to transcend the known. Our focus is on activating the capacity for immediate illumination."

          content: "Because everyone requires an approach appropriate to their level of maturity, educational background, and conceptual intelligence, we employ a range of processes for those not ready for the ultimate non-practice of immediate Self-realization. These include not only direct encounters with our teacher (a master of dharma combat, or zen dialogue), but also individual alchemical counseling sessions with an adept mentor. The latter provide a safe space in which to uproot projections, transform emotions, and release the residue of trauma as well as attachments to obsolete thinking and behavior patterns. We also offer powerful meditation methods. Once you have tasted the ecstasy of inner silence and serenity, you will not stop short of obtaining life's grand prize. Along with that, you will know the joy of altruism, devotion, artistic expression, and embodying the paradoxical wisdom of the Avadhutas (those who live in complete freedom)."
