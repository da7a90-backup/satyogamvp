      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

    content: [
      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

    content: [
      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',
      'We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required.'

      "Most of us had never even visited an ashram before arriving here. We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",
      "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.",
      'Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',
      'We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required.'

      "Most of us had never even visited an ashram before arriving here. We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",
      "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.",
      'Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',

      "Most of us had never even visited an ashram before arriving here. We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",
      "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.",
      'Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

We admire as well all the recent spiritual geniuses of India, including Ananda Mayi Ma, Yogananda, Swami Lakshmanjoo, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Nisargadatta. The Buddha Dharma is also appreciated and studied here. We learn from the great Christian mystics and their hesychasm and via negativa. We revel in the fiery drunkenness of the wild poetic Sufis and learn (and laugh at) the antics of trickster sages from the Daoist and Zen lineages, not to mention the fascinating formulations of the Hermeticists and Alchemists. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers—from Pythagoras and Parmenides to the Stoics and neo-Platonists—have also left us jewels of practical wisdom. Last but not least, important insights into consciousness and the Real have been discovered by scientists and delivered by recent paradigm-shifting thinkers. We distill and assimilate all of that.',

We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",

We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

We admire as well all the recent spiritual geniuses of India, including Ananda Mayi Ma, Yogananda, Swami Lakshmanjoo, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Nisargadatta. The Buddha Dharma is also appreciated and studied here. We learn from the great Christian mystics and their hesychasm and via negativa. We revel in the fiery drunkenness of the wild poetic Sufis and learn (and laugh at) the antics of trickster sages from the Daoist and Zen lineages, not to mention the fascinating formulations of the Hermeticists and Alchemists. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers—from Pythagoras and Parmenides to the Stoics and neo-Platonists—have also left us jewels of practical wisdom. Last but not least, important insights into consciousness and the Real have been discovered by scientists and delivered by recent paradigm-shifting thinkers. We distill and assimilate all of that.',

    content: [
      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',
      'We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

  description: 'The human ego in its current models is a fragmented and internally conflicted operating system. This condition creates affective and cognitive deadlocks, repetitive self-sabotage, delusional projections, and stunted capacity to function as a responsible adult. Spiritual practice must focus on the integration and resolution of contradictory attitudes and drives. Once accomplished, your consciousness can expand to higher levels of intelligence and creative power that can blossom into total freedom and fulfillment.',

      'An ashram is designed to provide the ideal environment for opening the mind and heart to our Infinite Nature. To fully heal from the wounds of egoic consciousness and become receptive to transmission of the Supreme Light of Being requires surrender to a higher will and to the support of a spiritual community.',
      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life.

      'An ashram is designed to provide the ideal environment for opening the mind and heart to our Infinite Nature. To fully heal from the wounds of egoic consciousness and become receptive to transmission of the Supreme Light of Being requires surrender to a higher will and to the support of a spiritual community.',
      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

    content: [
      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      'An ashram is designed to provide the ideal environment for opening the mind and heart to our Infinite Nature. To fully heal from the wounds of egoic consciousness and become receptive to transmission of the Supreme Light of Being requires surrender to a higher will and to the support of a spiritual community.',
      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

To fully heal from the wounds of egoic consciousness and become receptive to transmission of the Supreme Light of Being requires surrender to a higher will and to the support of a spiritual community.',
      'Very few are called to become permanent members of an ashram community, but all seekers of Truth can benefit from participating in ashram life for a time—taking a break from the world, immersing yourself in community dharma and spiritual practice, and learning to live ecologically on a small plot of land.',
      'Yet, most importantly, what will happen is that you will be invited into a new relationship with the God-Self that requires you to take radical responsibility for the transformation of consciousness needed for Liberation. As Jesus famously said, you cannot put new wine into old wineskins. You need a new mind—and a new identity.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',
      'We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required.'

      "Most of us had never even visited an ashram before arriving here. We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",
      "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.",
      'Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

We admire as well all the recent spiritual geniuses of India, including Ananda Mayi Ma, Yogananda, Swami Lakshmanjoo, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Nisargadatta. The Buddha Dharma is also appreciated and studied here. We learn from the great Christian mystics and their hesychasm and via negativa. We revel in the fiery drunkenness of the wild poetic Sufis and learn (and laugh at) the antics of trickster sages from the Daoist and Zen lineages, not to mention the fascinating formulations of the Hermeticists and Alchemists. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers—from Pythagoras and Parmenides to the Stoics and neo-Platonists—have also left us jewels of practical wisdom. Last but not least, important insights into consciousness and the Real have been discovered by scientists and delivered by recent paradigm-shifting thinkers. We distill and assimilate all of that.',

    content: [
      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."

      'What is different about an ashram established in the understanding that we are near the end of this age and of the whole cycle of history? We are not traditionalists or believers in a creed. We are not perfectionists, not necessarily ascetics, and mostly rebels and runaways; but the responsibilities of sustaining a farming community and serving in a wisdom school have refined our characters and given us at least a taste of divine ecstasy. We are not here to pass on any dogma, enlist anyone as a monk, or give out certificates. We are playing for higher stakes: Liberation.',
      'We understand that the chief responsibility of our residential sangha is to maintain an energy field filled with wisdom, love, and compassion—expressed as cheerfulness, friendship, cooperation, and forgiveness. And we are engaged in the constant practice of recognizing that all of reality is a single Consciousness.',
      'The ashram was founded in 2009 and has been sustained miraculously, thanks to the dedication, generosity, and faith of the founding members and the hard work and innovative ideas of those who came after them. The magnanimity of donors has been life-saving. We have also flourished thanks to the endless flow of new teachings—always more profound and powerful—transmitted through our yogic research director, Shunyamurti.',
      'We are not ordinary preppers or mere survivalists; but we do foresee the imminent collapse of civilization, and we intend to endure peacefully through the time of tribulations for so long as our service on this plane is required.'

      "Most of us had never even visited an ashram before arriving here. We grew up in the urban, materialist, consumerist, dumbed-down, puerile, and cynical culture that produced nearly everyone's ego—with a tenacious resistance to responsible adulthood and with few higher role models. We were saddled with a nihilistic attitude, seeking whatever crumbs of pleasure could be found. Fortunately, our karma got us to this refuge where we could start to heal our wounded souls.",
      "In short, we were not prepared for a life devoted to transcendence of the ego, nor even for managing a farm, a retreat center, and a complex website. We are learning on the go. That has added an edge of aliveness and willingness to accept beginner's mind, along with the thrill of solving enigmas and gasping in wonder at the impossible synchronicities that have kept us afloat.",
      'Even more miraculously, we have learned how to get along, how to accommodate the other, how to resolve conflicts, and (most importantly) how to stop projecting—instead, to eliminate attitudes that produce glitches in the field. We have learned how to disidentify from our own self-presentations, and we have learned the hard way—through our experience of karma and dharma and the sting of intense inner work—the vital importance of these teachings.'

      `To answer that, we must begin by understanding his chosen yogic name. Shunya means "empty," while murti means "form." In fact, all of us are empty forms, but most stay in denial of that. He wants to express and live in Truth.<br /><br />Emptiness is a central term, not only in Buddhism but in all the Asian wisdom schools. It signifies that the bodily character is unreal, a mere appearance in a holographic light show disguised as a world. Because one's persona is fictional, its suffering is empty of reality. This light show, or dream field, is made of the Light of Infinite Consciousness. Once there has been recognition of the emptiness of all forms, then the Real Self underlying, pervading, and dreaming this whole cosmic play can be realized. At that point, the other side of emptiness is revealed as the unmanifest, formless Fullness of eternal and unlimited freedom and joy.<br /><br />The One Intelligence is dreaming all of us and is the inmost Self of each apparent entity. In Shunyamurti's case, recognition of the fictional nature of the world and of people came early in life. That freed him from conventional constraints, enabling him to resist temptations to settle for anything less than the full unfoldment of the potency of Consciousness. Life became a quest for the Real.<br /><br />Grace comes as the power to silence the mind. In the stillness of Total Presence, energy and information from the Infinite Self can be channelled through the bodily icon. The teachings of Sat Yoga have come from that Source.`

We admire as well all the recent spiritual geniuses of India, including Ananda Mayi Ma, Yogananda, Swami Lakshmanjoo, Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Nisargadatta. The Buddha Dharma is also appreciated and studied here. We learn from the great Christian mystics and their hesychasm and via negativa. We revel in the fiery drunkenness of the wild poetic Sufis and learn (and laugh at) the antics of trickster sages from the Daoist and Zen lineages, not to mention the fascinating formulations of the Hermeticists and Alchemists. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers—from Pythagoras and Parmenides to the Stoics and neo-Platonists—have also left us jewels of practical wisdom. Last but not least, important insights into consciousness and the Real have been discovered by scientists and delivered by recent paradigm-shifting thinkers. We distill and assimilate all of that.',

    content: [
      "The Atman is the original yogic term for the uncreated Self. The Atman projects a soul, which then constructs an embodied ego. The ego mind, or psyche, is internally fragmented. Whereas psychology functions at the ego level, we work at the level of soul, from which the ego program can be more rapidly upgraded. The soul can then return to the Atman.<br /><br />Atmanology is offered in private one-to-one sessions. Here you will engage in creative mono-dialogue, in which you will feel the joy and release of being able to speak freely and openly from the heart, in a reverie state, as an act of Self-discovery rather than as a preconceived presentation of a persona to an Other.<br /><br />The Atmanologist will perceive the blind spots, the points of incoherence, and the contradictions that arise in your stream of consciousness, thus helping you draw out their hidden meanings. At key moments, the adept Atmanologist will intervene with an unexpected question or observation that suddenly breaks apart the ego's discourse, revealing a deeper, unknown intelligence. Superego voices may also appear, as well as the notorious Shadow lurking in the subconscious. Finally, an even more subtle presence will be unveiled: that of the soul. This will catapult your awareness to the Superconscious Atman.<br /><br />An Atmanologist has learned to interpret the language of dreams using the capacity to creatively unpack the symbols that arise, not only in one's remembered night dreams, but also in the world dream—especially in the physical and emotional symptoms and the daily synchronicities that reveal one's conscious internal narratives to be dream messages from the soul. These insights bring re-connection to the Atman—the Real Self. You can then awaken to the real beauty and poetry of life."
